# .github-private

Org-wide Copilot custom agents, automated workflows, prompts, scripts, and frameworks for `petry-projects`.

## What This Repo Does

This is the [`.github-private` convention](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/customize-cloud-agent/create-custom-agents) repo for the petry-projects org.
Agent profiles in `/agents/` are available org-wide — invocable from GitHub.com, VS Code, JetBrains, and Copilot CLI.

It also contains automated workflows (GitHub Actions agents running on events and schedules),
prompts, scripts, and the scheduled reporting dashboards that run across the org.

It also contains the scheduled PR review automation (workflows + scripts + prompts) that runs hourly across the org.

## @-Mention Agents

| Agent | Purpose | Invoke with |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| [`agentic-workflows`](agents/agentic-workflows.md) | Agentic workflow orchestration | `@agentic-workflows` in any org repo |
| [`compliance-auditor`](agents/compliance-auditor.md) | Audit repo against org standards | `@compliance-auditor` in any org repo |
| [`feature-ideator`](agents/feature-ideator.md) | Generate and prioritize feature ideas | `@feature-ideator` in any org repo |
| [`pr-reviewer`](agents/pr-reviewer.md) | Cascading PR review (triage → deep → security audit) with cross-engine adversarial review (see also [`pr-review-trigger.yml`](.github/workflows/pr-review-trigger.yml) for scheduled automation) | `@pr-reviewer` in any org PR |

## Automated Workflows

Autonomous agents that run as GitHub Actions, triggered by events or schedules across the org.

| Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [`ci-failure-analyst-reusable.yml`](.github/workflows/ci-failure-analyst-reusable.yml) | CI failure analyst — diagnoses failed CI/Lint/Test runs and comments root-cause analysis |
| [`dev-lead.yml`](.github/workflows/dev-lead.yml) | Dev-Lead agent — autonomously implements an assigned issue (branch, code, tests, PR) |
| [`feature-ideation.yml`](.github/workflows/feature-ideation.yml) | Feature research & ideation agent (BMAD Analyst) — turns sources into scoped feature ideas |
| [`idea-triage.yml`](.github/workflows/idea-triage.yml) | Idea triage agent — scores queued ideas and promotes them into the backlog |
| [`initiative-driver.yml`](.github/workflows/initiative-driver.yml) | Initiative driver — auto-releases an epic's ready sub-issues to Dev-Lead |
| [`initiative-planner.yml`](.github/workflows/initiative-planner.yml) | Initiative planner (BMAD Scrum Master) — breaks an approved initiative into an epic + sub-issues |
| [`issue-triage-runner.yml`](.github/workflows/issue-triage-runner.yml) | Issue triage agent — labels and routes newly opened issues |
| [`pr-review-trigger.yml`](.github/workflows/pr-review-trigger.yml) | PR review agent — cascading triage → deep → security review on open PRs across the org; auto-approves LOW/MEDIUM risk PRs with passing CI, escalates HIGH risk to human review (see also [`@pr-reviewer`](agents/pr-reviewer.md)). Trigger manually: `gh workflow run pr-review-trigger.yml --repo petry-projects/.github-private` or comment `@petry-review-bot` on any org PR |
| [`release-notes.yml`](.github/workflows/release-notes.yml) | Release-notes agent — drafts Keep-a-Changelog entries from merged PRs and opens a CHANGELOG PR |
| [`stale-manager.yml`](.github/workflows/stale-manager.yml) | Stale manager agent — warns and closes stale issues/PRs across the org |
