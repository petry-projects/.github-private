# Idea → Initiative pipeline

How a raw idea becomes auto-implementable work, and where the human gates are.

Two automated stages were added to close the gap between "idea" and
"in-flight": **idea-triage** (shortlist) and **initiative-planner** (the BMAD
Scrum Master). Each is bounded by a human gate, so judgement stays with a
maintainer:

| Gate | Signal | Who |
|------|--------|-----|
| Idea is worth planning | add `idea:approved` to the Discussion | human |
| Initiative is ready to build | add `initiative:auto` to the epic | human |

## The two new workflows

Both are **org-private automation** (like `initiative-driver.yml`), not thin
caller stubs. Tooling and the vendored BMAD personas live in this repo and are
unit-tested.

### Idea enhancement — `feature-ideation`'s enhancement mode (the single enhancer)

There is exactly **one** Discussion-triggered enhancer. The standalone
`idea-enhancer.yml` (with its `scripts/idea-enhancer/` tooling) has been
**removed** (#876) now that its capability is fully folded into the
`feature-ideation` reusable workflow (epic #872) — so a human-authored idea is
enhanced **once**, never twice.

For each open, human-authored, not-yet-enhanced **Ideas** Discussion the folded
enhancer posts **one** comment (sharpened problem/goal, repo + market context,
impact/effort, suggested acceptance criteria). Bot-authored ideas are skipped —
they are already AI-generated. It never approves, labels, or promotes — that
stays with triage and the human gates.

The enhancement logic lives in the **central** reusable `petry-projects/.github`
(`feature-ideation-reusable.yml`); `.github-private` ships only the thin
`feature-ideation.yml` caller stub (pinned to the `@feature-ideation/next`
dogfood ring), which exposes the enhancement modes as `workflow_dispatch`
inputs.

- **Backfill sweep** — dispatch `feature-ideation` with `enhance_backlog: true`.
  It sweeps the target repo's open, human-authored, not-yet-enhanced **Ideas**
  Discussions and posts **exactly one** structured enhancement comment each.
  Bot-authored and already-enhanced ideas are skipped. This is the safety-net
  backfill that catches human ideas added before the folded enhancer went live.
- **Dry-run** — dispatch with `dry_run: true` **and** `enhance_backlog: true`.
  Every intended per-Discussion enhancement comment is logged to the JSONL
  artifact and **nothing** is posted (one artifact entry per candidate
  Discussion). The dry-run is free of model spend beyond candidate gathering.
- **Marker continuity (cutover-safe).** The idempotency check honors **both**
  the legacy `<!-- idea-enhancer:enhanced -->` marker and the canonical
  `<!-- feature-ideation:enhanced -->` marker; new enhancement comments emit the
  single canonical marker. So **no** idea enhanced by the old `idea-enhancer` is
  re-enhanced after the cutover, and a repeated backfill is a no-op.
- **Cost.** Operator-triggered (`workflow_dispatch`), **no new cron** — the
  backfill reuses `feature-ideation`'s existing model budget and 20-minute
  timeout, so it is cost-neutral-to-reducing.

#### Operator runbook — backfilling the `.github-private` backlog

1. **Dry-run first.** Run the **Feature Research & Ideation** workflow via
   *Run workflow* with `enhance_backlog: true` **and** `dry_run: true`. Download
   the dry-run JSONL artifact and confirm its entry count equals an independent
   count of open, human-authored, not-yet-enhanced Ideas (the candidate set).
   Nothing is posted.
2. **Go live.** Re-dispatch with `enhance_backlog: true` and `dry_run: false`.
   After one live run, every open, human-authored, not-yet-enhanced Idea carries
   exactly one structured enhancement comment — the un-enhanced backlog drops to
   **0**.
3. **Verify idempotency.** A second live backfill run posts **0** new comments
   (no idea is double-enhanced, including ideas already carrying the legacy
   marker) — the idempotency guarantee that let the standalone `idea-enhancer`
   be retired (#876).

### `idea-triage.yml` — weekly ripeness shortlist
- Scans every open **Ideas** Discussion, scores each **Ripe / Soon / Not yet**
  on evidence, prerequisites, alignment, coverage, and freshness.
- Rewrites a single **Idea Promotion Queue** tracking issue (label
  `idea-triage`) with the ranked list and a pre-drafted promotion note per ripe
  idea. It **never** applies `idea:approved` — that's the human's pick.
- Tooling: `scripts/idea-triage/{gather-ideas,upsert-queue}.sh`.

### `initiative-planner.yml` — BMAD Scrum Master "Bob"
- Trigger: a Discussion gets labelled `idea:approved`, or manual
  `workflow_dispatch` with a discussion number (`dry_run` defaults to **true**).
- **Follows the real BMAD Method skills, vendored agent-agnostically under
  `frameworks/`** (BMM v6.8.0 at `frameworks/bmad-method/` + **Test Architect**
  v1.19.0 at `frameworks/bmad-test-architecture/`; `src/` skill trees only, see
  `prompts/bmad/README.md`). The planner reads the skills **by path** (not via any
  vendor-specific `.<tool>/skills` dir), following `bmad-sprint-planning` +
  `bmad-create-story` (and the Test Architect `bmad-tea`/`testarch`, the agent
  behind the `qa-lead` persona, where useful) —
  not a paraphrase. Stories are emitted in the canonical BMAD **create-story
  template** (Story / Acceptance Criteria / Tasks-Subtasks / Dev Notes / Project
  Structure Notes / References) and self-checked against the create-story
  **checklist**.
- Reads the approved idea + repo context, runs sprint-planning + create-story,
  and emits a schema-validated **initiative plan** (`plan.schema.json`, which
  mirrors the BMAD template field-for-field): an epic + 3–8 PR-sized stories
  with testable acceptance criteria, AC-referencing tasks, grounded Dev Notes,
  sizes, and a `blocked_by` DAG. Prerequisites already tracked as issues become
  `blocked_by_existing_issues` edges, not new stories.
- Materializes the epic + native sub-issue DAG via `apply-plan.sh`, labelled
  `initiative` only. **It never applies `initiative:auto`** — the epic is created
  inert and a human activates it after review. `hands_off` stories also get
  `dev-lead:hands-off` + `initiative:hold` so the driver never auto-releases them.
- **Plan → review → apply split (#604).** A dry-run uploads the authoritative
  `plan.json` (the `initiative-plan-dry-run` artifact) and creates nothing. A
  maintainer can download and review it, then re-dispatch with
  `plan_artifact_run_id` set to the dry-run's run ID: the workflow re-downloads
  that artifact, **skips Bob entirely (no re-plan)**, and validates + applies
  it via `apply-reviewed-plan.sh` — so *what a maintainer reviewed is what
  materializes*. With `plan_artifact_run_id` empty, the default plan-then-apply
  flow is unchanged. The handoff is artifact-download-by-run-ID; the artifact
  is re-fetched from GitHub Actions and not taken from a local file. This plan-review gate is **distinct** from the `initiative:auto` gate: the
  former binds the plan *contents*, the latter activates auto-*implementation*.
- Tooling: `scripts/initiative-planner/` (persona: `prompts/bmad/scrum-master.md`).

## Labels the pipeline relies on

| Label | On | Meaning |
|-------|----|---------|
| `idea:approved` | Discussion | Human blessed this idea for planning → fires the planner |
| `idea-triage` | Issue | Marks the Idea Promotion Queue tracking issue |
| `initiative` | Epic + stories | Part of a tracked initiative |
| `initiative:auto` | Epic | Human activated auto-implementation (driver may release) |
| `initiative:hold` / `dev-lead:hands-off` | Story | Never auto-released; needs a human |

## Safety properties

- **Two human gates**, both opt-in labels. Nothing reaches `dev-lead` without a
  maintainer adding `idea:approved` then `initiative:auto`.
- **Dry-run first.** The planner defaults `dry_run: true` on manual dispatch and
  logs every intended mutation to an artifact; triage supports the same.
- **Auto is never self-applied.** `apply-plan.sh` cannot emit `initiative:auto`
  (enforced by `tests/test_initiative_planner.bats`).
- **DAG is validated** (acyclic, has an entry point, no dangling edges) before
  any issue is created.

## Fleet enablement (any org repo)

The pipeline runs for any BMAD-enabled org repo, not just this one. The BMAD
frameworks, the planner, and the triage/enhancer tooling stay vendored **once**
here; each fleet repo ships only thin **caller stubs** (copied from petry-projects/.github/standards/workflows/{initiative-planner,idea-triage,feature-ideation}.yml into their local .github/workflows/ directory).

```
fleet repo: ★ human adds idea:approved to an Ideas Discussion
   │
   ▼
initiative-planner.yml (stub) ──> initiative-planner-reusable.yml (@initiative-planner/stable)
   │   (claude-code-action can't run on `discussion` events, so the reusable
   │    re-DISPATCHES the central planner instead of planning inline)
   ▼
petry-projects/.github-private  initiative-planner.yml  -f target_repo=<fleet repo> -f dry_run=false
   │   reads the fleet repo's Discussion, writes the epic + DAG THERE
   │   (cross-repo writes use GH_PAT_WORKFLOWS; self path uses GITHUB_TOKEN)
   ▼
inert epic + story DAG in the fleet repo
   │
   ▼
fleet repo: ★ human adds initiative:auto to the epic   (+ a sub-issue closes later)
   │
   ▼
initiative-driver.yml (stub) ──> initiative-driver-reusable.yml (@stable)
   │   (the driver's gate/DAG tooling lives ONCE here, so the stub forwards the
   │    fleet repo's issues:[labeled initiative:auto] / issues:[closed] event to
   │    the central driver instead of running the release logic inline)
   ▼
petry-projects/.github-private  initiative-driver.yml  -f target_repo=<fleet repo>
   │   sweeps the fleet repo's initiative:auto epics, resolves each ready story's
   │   blocked_by DAG, and applies the `dev-lead` label THERE
   │   (cross-repo writes use GH_PAT_WORKFLOWS; self path uses GITHUB_TOKEN)
   ▼
dev-lead.yml (fleet repo) ──> PR ──> pr-review ──> merge ──> closing a story re-fires the stub
```

The two legs are symmetric: the **planner** leg turns an approved idea into an
inert epic + DAG in the fleet repo; the **driver** leg releases that epic's
ready stories to `dev-lead` cross-repo once a human arms it. Both ship only a
thin per-repo stub and dispatch the central workflow with `target_repo`.

- **`target_repo`** parameterizes the central planner/triage/enhancer **and the
  driver**; empty ⇒ the dogfood/self path (`.github-private` plans + drives its
  own issues), non-empty ⇒ the named fleet repo.
- **Project-board funnel (hybrid):** epics in **consumer (fleet) repos** land on
  that repo's own project; epics in **`petry-projects/.github` and
  `petry-projects/.github-private`** land on the org-level "Initiatives" project
  (`orgs/petry-projects/projects/1`).
- **Regression detection:** `initiative-planner-canary.yml` smoke-tests the live
  `idea:approved` → dispatch path and `initiative-driver-canary.yml` smoke-tests the
  symmetric cross-repo release path (a dry-run `target_repo` dispatch of the driver),
  while Fleet Monitor watches each adopted stub for drift — so a silent revert of
  either trigger (the [#655](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github-private/issues/655)
  class) surfaces immediately rather than on a maintainer noticing nothing planned or released.
- **Adoption + the full enrollment runbook:** see
  `petry-projects/.github` → `standards/ci-standards.md` §10 (Idea → Initiative pipeline).
