# Agent-ingress collapse package — `petry-projects/markets` (pilot, ADR-0007 Phase 3)

> **What this document is.** A reviewable *collapse package* for the pilot repo
> `petry-projects/markets`, produced by dev-lead in `.github-private` under
> issue #1729. It is **not** the markets pull request and cannot be — a
> `.github-private` agent has no write path into `markets`. Everything here is
> built by *reading* markets' live stubs (`gh api …/contents/.github/workflows`),
> never by authoring in that repo. The markets PR is opened by markets' own
> dev-lead, driven by the companion issue this package ships (§10).
>
> The package is complete on its own: it carries the exact `agent-ingress.yml`
> content for markets, the enumerated eligible set with justified carve-outs, the
> old→new required-check name mapping, the baseline citation (§1), the
> skip-billing statement (§7), and the pre-merge gate + rollback for both
> half-landed states (§8).

## 1. Baseline (AC5)

The **structural byte-identity baseline** every Phase-1 story hashes and consumes
is the canonical reference, emittable as a machine artifact:

- `docs/architecture/reference/agent-ingress.yml` — the 2-role canonical shape
  (dev-lead + pr-review-mention), emittable via
  `scripts/seed-repo-template.sh --emit-workflow agent-ingress.yml` (#1724 AC #3).

The **behavioral baseline** this collapse must preserve is markets' current fleet
of per-role Class-1 caller stubs on `main`, read live on 2026-09-29:

| Role stub (markets `.github/workflows/…`) | Pinned reusable ref |
| --- | --- |
| `dev-lead.yml` | `…/.github-private/…/dev-lead-reusable.yml@dev-lead/v139-stable` |
| `pr-auto-review.yml` | `…/.github/…/pr-auto-review-reusable.yml@pr-auto-review/v1-stable` |
| `pr-review.yml` | `…/.github-private/…/pr-review.yml@pr-review/stable` |
| `pr-review-mention.yml` | `…/.github/…/pr-review-mention-reusable.yml@pr-review-mention/v2-stable` |
| `ci-failure-analyst.yml` | `…/.github-private/…/ci-failure-analyst-reusable.yml@79747178007d3238bb3afddf7f4d952a293987bd` |

**Later pin bump (#2171):** Dependabot bumped markets `main`'s
`ci-failure-analyst.yml` stub to `@b58510275dd1cbbd13c0733c15265d51fd63b992`
(markets `e390f85`, 2026-10-06). §3 carries that pin so the collapse does not
revert it. See §5b.

> **Gap (named, not silently carried):** the delivery brief cites a baseline doc
> at `docs/initiatives/agent-ingress-collapse-baseline.md`. That file **does not
> exist** on `main`. The authoritative baseline is the pair above (the canonical
> reference for structure + the live pre-collapse stubs for behavior). If a
> dedicated baseline doc is wanted, it should be filed separately; this package
> does not fabricate one.

The collapse is **behavior-preserving**: each job in the ingress copies its
source stub's pin, `permissions:`, `secrets:`, and event subscription verbatim,
modulo the mechanical `on:`→union / per-role `if:` reconstruction below. The
one exception is the ADR-0010 concurrency re-rendering, which changes how
non-PR events are grouped for `pr-auto-review` and `pr-review` (stated in §4b).

## 2. Enumerated eligible set (what collapses) with justified carve-outs

markets carries 18 workflow files. Classification of every one:

### 2a. COLLAPSE — Class-1, event-driven, non-`pull_request_target` agentic roles (5)

| Role | Trigger family | Why eligible |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dev-lead` | pull_request / review / comment / issues / check_run / repository_dispatch | Class-1 event-driven; no `pull_request_target`. |
| `pr-auto-review` | workflow_run / check_suite / pull_request_review / pull_request | Class-1 event-driven; no `pull_request_target`. |
| `pr-review` | check_suite / pull_request_review / pull_request / workflow_dispatch / repository_dispatch | Class-1 event-driven; no `pull_request_target`. |
| `pr-review-mention` | issue_comment / pull_request_review_comment / pull_request(review_requested) | Class-1 event-driven; no `pull_request_target`. |
| `ci-failure-analyst` | check_run | Class-1 event-driven; no `pull_request_target`. |

### 2b. CARVE-OUT — keep their own per-role stub

| Workflow | Reason (ADR-0007 boundary) |
| --- | --- |
| `add-to-project.yml` | `pull_request_target` role — excluded, not negotiable on file-count grounds. |
| `dependabot-automerge.yml` | `pull_request_target` role. |
| `dependabot-rebase.yml` | `pull_request_target` role. |
| `auto-rebase.yml` | Documented repo-local trigger stub; keeps its own stub. |
| `feature-ideation.yml` | Class-3 (scheduled/clock-origin) — excluded. |
| `initiative-driver.yml` | Class-3 (scheduled/clock-origin) — excluded. |

> Each carve-out above must be re-confirmed by markets' dev-lead against the live
> file before merge (trigger type can change). The classification is read from
> the `on:` block and the class table in `docs/agentic-interaction-model.md` §4.

### 2c. EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED — required-check gate workflows (decision recorded)

| Workflow | Decision | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent-shield.yml` | **EXCLUDE** | It is a **required-check gate** (`agent-shield / AgentShield`, see §6), not an agentic role. ADR-0007 puts CI/gate workflows out of scope; `agent-shield.yml` is additionally a protected thin-caller exempt from modification (AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md). It also triggers on `push`, which the ingress `on:` union does not carry. |
| `dependency-audit.yml` | **EXCLUDE** | It is a **required-check gate** (`dependency-audit / Detect ecosystems`, see §6), not an agentic role. Out of scope per ADR-0007; also `push`-triggered. |

### 2d. Out of scope entirely — non-agentic CI / plumbing

`ci.yml`, `sonarcloud.yml`, `shell-tests.yml`, `apply-repo-settings.yml`,
`copilot-setup-steps.yml` — non-agentic CI, settings, or setup workflows. Never
in scope for the ingress collapse.

---

## 3. The exact `agent-ingress.yml` content for `markets`

Behavior-preserving collapse of the 5 roles in §2a. Built to the #1724 canonical
structure: `on:` = union of the five stubs' triggers; `permissions: {}` at top
level; exactly one job per role carrying the role name; each job with its own
per-job pin (moved down a tier from the per-file pin, ADR-0002), its own
`permissions:`, its own `secrets:`, and a **pure event-filter `if:`** that
reconstructs that role's original subscription.

> **Two pins below are defective and are preserved *as-is for pilot parity* while
> being NAMED here — see §5 for the follow-up corrections.** A behavior-preserving
> collapse must not silently "fix" a pin in the same change that moves it; the
> corrections are separate follow-ups.
>
> **Job-level `concurrency:` — ruled by ADR-0010, accepted (see §4).** Three
> source stubs carry a *workflow-level* `concurrency:` block. A single collapsed
> workflow cannot host three workflow-level groups, so they are rendered as
> **job-level** `concurrency:` below. ADR-0010 admits this one key into
> ADR-0007's ingress schema, with bounds. Each group is a role-prefixed literal
> head plus event-payload parts only, and each `cancel-in-progress` is a literal
> boolean. The `pr-auto-review` and `pr-review` blocks were re-rendered to those
> bounds (#2038). §4b states what this changes for non-PR events.
>
> **Synced to the deployed file (#2171).** The YAML below matches the
> `agent-ingress.yml` that markets#513 ships. It differs from the first ratified
> text (#2039) in the `pr-auto-review` group (per-event slot, §4b) and the
> `ci-failure-analyst` pin (§5b). The maintainer accepted both changes.

### 3a. `if:` predicate provenance (every guard is a pure event filter)

Each construct below is either an explicit ALLOW row in
`tests/fixtures/agent-ingress/if-filter-rulings.tsv` or a plain read of a
delivered-event payload field (the ALLOW principle: "payload fields read as a
plain predicate are the delta that woke the ingress"). None reaches
vars/secrets/needs/hashFiles/repo-identity/default_branch/standing-labels.

| Construct used | Ruling |
| --- | --- |
| `github.event_name == …` | ALLOW (`event-name`) |
| `github.event.action == …` / `contains(fromJSON('[…]'), github.event.action)` | ALLOW (`event-action`) |
| `github.event.pull_request.base.ref == 'main'` | ALLOW (`base-ref`) |
| `github.event.sender.type != 'Bot'` | payload field as predicate — PASSES the guard |
| `github.event.check_run.conclusion` / `.name` | payload field as predicate — PASSES the guard |
| `github.event.check_suite.pull_requests[0] != null` | event-association null-check on the delivered payload (NOT the standing labels array) — PASSES the guard |

> **Verified empirically.** The exact §3 ingress was run through the frozen #1725
> guard (`.dev-lead/scripts/validate-ingress-if.sh`, which consumes the rulings
> TSV directly) against this repo's rulings fixture:
> `ingress-if: OK — every agent-ingress job is a thin caller with a pure

## 4. Job-level `concurrency:` — ruled: ADR-0010 (accepted)

`pr-auto-review.yml`, `pr-review.yml`, and `ci-failure-analyst.yml` each carry a
**workflow-level** `concurrency:` block in their source stubs; `dev-lead.yml`
centralizes concurrency inside its reusable (no caller block). One collapsed
workflow cannot host three distinct workflow-level groups without cross-role
cancellation, so §3 renders each as a **job-level** `concurrency:` block —
GitHub Actions supports job-level concurrency, and it preserves each role's
grouping in isolation.

**The ruling (delivered):**
[ADR-0010](../architecture/adr/0010-ingress-job-level-concurrency-and-exhaustive-schema.md),
status **accepted** (Solution Architect ruling #2001, accepted in #2036). It
extends ADR-0007 without superseding it. It admits exactly one key,
`concurrency:`, into ADR-0007's ingress schema, with these bounds:

- `group` reads only the event-payload surface a job-level `if:` may read. It is
  checked by the same `viif_forbidden` predicate.
- `cancel-in-progress` is a literal boolean (`true` or `false`), never an
  expression.
- Every result the group can begin with carries the role name as a prefix
  (`<role>-…`).
- The group does not match a group that the role's pinned reusable declares.

ADR-0010 also records that ADR-0007's schema is an **exhaustive allowlist**.
This package therefore uses no `strategy:`, `env:` or `continue-on-error:`. The
ADR-0007 addendum this section used to recommend was not available, because an
accepted ADR is immutable. ADR-0010 is the delivered form of that reading.

### 4a. Conformance of the §3 blocks

| Role | `group` (leading literal) | `cancel-in-progress` | Pinned reusable's groups | Collision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pr-auto-review` | `pr-auto-review-…` (per-event slot, §4b) | `true` | none (`pr-auto-review-reusable.yml@pr-auto-review/v1-stable`) | none |
| `pr-review` | `pr-review-…` | `true` | `pr-review-pr-{…}`, `pr-review-batch` (`pr-review.yml@pr-review/stable`) | none (see the `enumerate` note in §4b) |
| `ci-failure-analyst` | `ci-failure-analyst-…` (unchanged) | `false` (unchanged) | none (`ci-failure-analyst-reusable.yml@b585102…`) | none |
| `dev-lead`, `pr-review-mention` | no caller block | — | — | — |

Both guards pass on the §3 ingress as rendered: `scripts/validate-ingress-if.sh`
(event surface, role prefix, literal boolean) and
`scripts/validate-caller-inputs.sh` (no collision at the pinned ref).
`tests/agent_ingress_markets_package.bats` extracts the §3 YAML from this file
and runs both guards on it, so the package cannot drift out of conformance
unnoticed.

### 4b. What changes versus the source stubs (the cost of dropping `run_id`)

ADR-0010 forbids the `github.run_id` and `inputs.*` fallbacks. Without
`run_id`, an event that names no PR needs a different key for its slot. Each
role resolves this as follows.

**`pr-auto-review`.** The source stub used `pr-auto-review-ready-check-pr-<n>`
for `pull_request` and `pull_request_review`, with cancel enabled. It gave every
`check_suite` and `workflow_run` event a unique `…-unique-<run_id>` slot that was
never cancelled.

- PR events keep **one slot per PR**, `pr-auto-review-<n>`, with
  `cancel-in-progress: true`. A newer push or review still supersedes an
  in-flight check for the same PR. Only the slot name changed (the
  `ready-check-pr-` infix is gone).
- Non-PR events get **one slot per event**: `pr-auto-review-<check_suite.id>` or
  `pr-auto-review-<workflow_run.id>`. Each delivered `check_suite` or
  `workflow_run` carries its own id, so it is never cancelled by a different
  event. This is close to the stub's unique per-run slot, read from the event
  payload instead of `run_id`. Uniqueness is not kept in the reusable, because
  `pr-auto-review-reusable.yml` declares no concurrency at its pin.
- **What this changes from the earlier §4b text (#2038):** that text keyed
  non-PR events on `head_sha` (`pr-auto-review-ready-check-sha-<head_sha>`). A
  later `check_suite` or `workflow_run` for the same commit cancelled an
  in-flight readiness check for that commit. **That no longer happens.** Every
  non-PR event runs to completion, as it did under the source stub.
- **Why (#1126):** the source stub documents the hazard. When several PRs share
  a commit, a `check_suite` or `workflow_run` cannot say which PR it is for
  (`pull_requests[0]` is indeterminate), so one PR's events cancelled the other
  PR's. A per-commit slot brings that cross-PR cancellation back. A per-event
  slot does not. The cost is that close-together suites for one commit each run
  a readiness check instead of collapsing to the latest one.
- **Why not `cancel-in-progress: false`:** the value is one literal for the
  whole job. `false` would make PR events queue behind a run for a stale head
  instead of superseding it, which changes the source stub's PR-event behavior.
- **Edge cases:** a re-run of the same workflow run or check suite reuses its
  id, so its completion event can cancel the earlier run for that id. That is
  harmless, because both read the same run. A payload with none of the three
  fields (not expected for these events) resolves to the literal slot
  `pr-auto-review-none`. PR numbers and event ids share the `pr-auto-review-`
  namespace. Event ids are far larger than any markets PR number, so the two do
  not overlap in practice.

**`pr-review`.** The source stub used
`pr-review-<PR number | check_suite PR | inputs.pr_url | client_payload.pr_url | run_id>`
with cancel enabled.

- Every event that names a PR is **unchanged**. That covers `pull_request`,
  `pull_request_review`, `check_suite` (the `if:` already drops a check_suite
  with no PR), `workflow_dispatch` with `pr_url`, and a `pr-review-mention`
  dispatch with `client_payload.pr_url`. They use the same slot as before with
  `cancel-in-progress: true`. For a `workflow_dispatch` run,
  `github.event.inputs.pr_url` is the event payload and holds the value the
  source stub read through the `inputs` context. The `inputs` context itself is
  not read.
- A `workflow_dispatch` with no `pr_url` (a whole-repo sweep, including dry
  runs), or a mention dispatch with no `client_payload.pr_url`, now **shares one
  literal slot, `pr-review-enumerate`**.
- **Behavior change:** a later sweep now **cancels an in-flight sweep**, and the
  latest request wins. Before, each sweep had a unique caller slot. Sweeps still
  ran one at a time with one pending, through the reusable's own
  `pr-review-batch` group (cancel off), so a second sweep queued instead of
  cancelling the first. A dry-run sweep and a live sweep now cancel each other.
  Do not start one while the other is in flight.
- **Uniqueness inside the reusable:** the reusable keeps its own per-PR and
  per-SHA slots (`pr-review-pr-…`) and its `pr-review-batch` slot. Nothing is
  added to it.
- **Why the fallback is `enumerate` and not `batch`:** a caller literal of
  `batch` would resolve to `pr-review-batch`, the reusable's own group, and the
  caller would queue behind or cancel its own nested run. The ADR-0010 stem check
  would not catch that, because the stems `pr-review-` and `pr-review-batch`
  differ. The regression test pins the `enumerate` literal.

**`ci-failure-analyst`.** Unchanged:
`ci-failure-analyst-${{ github.event.check_run.head_sha }}` with
`cancel-in-progress: false`. It already conformed, so its behavior does not
change.

## 5. The two defective pins (named, with follow-up corrections)

Both are preserved as-is in §3 for behavior parity in the pilot, and flagged
inline with `# DEFECTIVE PIN`. Neither is silently carried:

### 5a. `pr-review` → `@pr-review/stable` (stale / non-standard channel)

- **Defect:** every other first-party pin rides a `<name>/v<MAJOR>-<tier>`
  channel (`dev-lead/v139-stable`, `pr-auto-review/v1-stable`,
  `pr-review-mention/v2-stable`). `pr-review/stable` is a bare tier with **no
  major version** — a pre-ADR-0002 channel name that skips the MAJOR ring. It is
  exposed to the channel-skew defect class (#1052/#1034).
- **Follow-up:** repoint to the current `pr-review/v<MAJOR>-stable` channel once
  it is published, and confirm the reusable's `workflow_call.inputs` match the
  forwarded `agent_ref`/`pr_url`/`dry_run`/`force_review`. Track as a separate
  issue against the `pr-review` reusable owner; **do not** bundle into the
  collapse PR.

### 5b. `ci-failure-analyst` → `@b58510275dd1cbbd13c0733c15265d51fd63b992` (bare SHA aliased to `main`)

- **Pin bump (#2171):** the first ratified §3 pinned
  `@79747178007d3238bb3afddf7f4d952a293987bd`. Dependabot then bumped markets
  `main`'s stub to `@b58510275dd1cbbd13c0733c15265d51fd63b992` (markets
  `e390f85`, `139.33.0` → `139.43.0`). §3 now carries the bumped pin, so the
  collapse moves the stub's current pin and does not revert the bump. The
  reusable at `b585102…` declares no `concurrency:` and only the
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret, so the ADR-0010 collision result (§4a) is
  unchanged. The test snapshot
  `tests/fixtures/agent-ingress/markets-pinned-reusables/ci-failure-analyst-reusable.yml`
  records the new pin.

- **Defect:** a frozen commit SHA (commented `# main`), not a moving channel tag
  — a direct ADR-0002 violation. It pins to a raw commit that will never advance
  and is not covered by the ring-promotion model; a fix to
  `ci-failure-analyst-reusable.yml` cannot reach markets without editing this
  pin by hand.
- **Follow-up:** publish/adopt a `ci-failure-analyst/v<MAJOR>-stable` channel tag
  and repoint. Track against the `ci-failure-analyst` reusable owner in
  `.github-private`; **do not** bundle into the collapse PR.

> Keeping both as-is in the collapse is the correct pilot call: a
> behavior-preserving collapse changes *where* the pin lives (per-file → per-job),
> not *what* it points at. Correcting a channel in the same change would confound
> "the collapse is behavior-identical" with "the pin changed," making rollback
> attribution ambiguous.

## 6. Old → new required-check name mapping (AC — name mapping)

Check context format is `<caller-job-key> / <reusable-internal-job-name>`.
Reusable internal job names, read on 2026-09-29:

| Role | Reusable internal job(s) | Old check context (per-role stub job key) | New check context (ingress job key) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dev-lead | `dispatch`, `ci-relay`, `resume` (dev-lead-reusable.yml) | `dev-lead / dispatch` etc. | `dev-lead / dispatch` etc. (job key unchanged) |
| pr-auto-review | reusable internal job (pr-auto-review-reusable.yml) | `pr-auto-review / <job>` | `pr-auto-review / <job>` |
| pr-review | `review` (pr-review.yml) | `review / review` | `pr-review / review` |
| pr-review-mention | reusable internal job (pr-review-mention-reusable.yml) | `pr-review-mention / <job>` | `pr-review-mention / <job>` |
| ci-failure-analyst | `analyze` (ci-failure-analyst-reusable.yml) | `analyze / analyze` | `ci-failure-analyst / analyze` |

> **KEY FINDING — no required-status-check edit is coupled to this merge.**
> markets' branch ruleset (`GET /repos/petry-projects/markets/rules/branches/main`,
> read 2026-09-29) requires exactly:

## 7. Skip-billing statement (AC10 — kind (a) only)

Every skip introduced by this collapse is **kind (a): job-level `if:` event-filter
skip** — evaluated by the Actions service *before* a runner is assigned, costing
**zero runner minutes**. When markets receives a union event a given role does not
subscribe to (e.g. `dev-lead` on a `check_suite` completion), that role's job is
`if:`-skipped with no runner.

This collapse introduces **no kind (b)** skips. Kind (b) — a reusable-internal
changed-path check that holds a runner before skipping — arises only when a
`paths:` filter is pushed down into a reusable (ADR-0007 consequence, e.g.
`dependency-advisory.yml`). **None of the 5 markets roles uses a `paths:` filter**
in its source stub, so no `paths:` filter moves down a tier and no per-event
runner cost is incurred. The billing profile is therefore strictly
event-filtered, no-runner skips.

---

## 8. Pre-merge gate + rollback for both half-landed states (AC3 / AC8)

This is a **package deliverable describing the gate and rollback**, not a merge
performed here.

### 8a. Pre-merge gate (markets dev-lead runs this before merging the collapse PR)

1. **Re-read the ruleset** (`GET …/markets/rules/branches/main`) and confirm none
   of `dev-lead`, `pr-auto-review`, `pr-review`, `pr-review-mention`,
   `ci-failure-analyst` has become a required check. If any has, STOP — the
   atomic rename in §8d applies.
2. **Confirm carve-outs unchanged** — the 6 files in §2b still carry their
   `pull_request_target` / repo-local / Class-3 triggers.
3. **Run the #1725 if-linter** over `agent-ingress.yml` — every job `if:` must
   pass as a pure event filter (validates the three "ALLOW-consistent" predicates
   in §3a).
4. **§4 concurrency ruling — ratified** (ADR-0010, accepted). Job-level
   `concurrency:` is permitted within ADR-0010's bounds. Re-run
   `validate-ingress-if.sh` and `validate-caller-inputs.sh` over
   `agent-ingress.yml`. Both must pass: bounded groups, literal
   `cancel-in-progress`, no collision with a group the pinned reusable declares.
5. **Confirm byte-identity** of each job block against the canonical
   agent-ingress template once published (§9) via `caller_stub_freeze.sh` /
   `fleet_monitor.sh` role-path.

### 8b. The collapse PR is a two-file change in markets

- **ADD** `.github/workflows/agent-ingress.yml` (§3 content).
- **DELETE** the 5 per-role stubs (`dev-lead.yml`, `pr-auto-review.yml`,
  `pr-review.yml`, `pr-review-mention.yml`, `ci-failure-analyst.yml`).

Both halves in **one PR, one commit** so the add and the deletes land atomically.

### 8c. The two half-landed states and why both are safe here

Because **no collapsing role is a required check** (§6), neither half-landed state
can block a merge:

- **State A — ingress added, stubs not yet deleted (double-dispatch window).**
  Both `agent-ingress.yml` and the old stubs fire → each role runs *twice* per
  event. Wasteful and log-noisy, but not a correctness or gating failure (agentic
  roles are idempotent per-head-SHA; `pr-review`/`pr-auto-review` concurrency
  groups collapse duplicates only where the old and new groups coincide — PR-keyed
  events; the old `check_suite`/`workflow_run` stub groups were unique per run, so
  those events may still double-run in this window). **Rollback:** revert the ingress add; the stubs
  alone resume normal single dispatch.
- **State B — stubs deleted, ingress not yet added (coverage gap window).**
  No event-driven agent runs in markets until the ingress lands. No required
  check depends on them, so **merges are not blocked** — only agent assistance is
  paused. **Rollback:** restore the 5 stubs (revert the delete); dispatch resumes.

Landing both halves in one commit (§8b) means neither transient state is ever
committed to `main`; they are described here only to prove rollback safety.

### 8d. Atomic-rename contingency (only if §8a step 1 fails)

If, at PR time, any of the 5 roles has become a required check, then the ruleset
edit renaming the old check context to the new (§6 mapping) **must land in the
same change** as the collapse (ADR-0007), because branch protection would
otherwise block on a check that no longer exists (State A) or wait forever on one
never produced (State B). As read on 2026-09-29 this contingency does **not**
apply.

## 9. AC11 (prepared, activation deferred) — STUB_REGISTRY rows + canonical template

Two AC11 pieces are **cross-repo or post-collapse and cannot be completed from
`.github-private` now**; they are prepared here ready-to-apply.

### 9a. Ready-to-apply `STUB_REGISTRY` rows (scripts/fleet_monitor.sh)

Row format (from `fleet_monitor.sh`):
`name⇥label⇥stub_path⇥canonical_path⇥role⇥legacy_path⇥legacy_canonical_path`.
The per-job **role** selector makes the comparison unit the extracted
`<role>` job block of `agent-ingress.yml`; **legacy_path** is the pre-collapse
per-role stub consulted only while a repo carries no `agent-ingress.yml` (#1726
AC #4).

```
$'dev-lead\tDev-Lead\t.github/workflows/agent-ingress.yml\t<CANONICAL agent-ingress path>\tdev-lead\t.github/workflows/dev-lead.yml\t<legacy dev-lead canonical>'
$'pr-auto-review\tPR-Auto-Review\t.github/workflows/agent-ingress.yml\t<CANONICAL agent-ingress path>\tpr-auto-review\t.github/workflows/pr-auto-review.yml\tstandards/workflows/pr-auto-review.yml'
$'pr-review\tPR-Review\t.github/workflows/agent-ingress.yml\t<CANONICAL agent-ingress path>\tpr-review\t.github/workflows/pr-review.yml\t<legacy pr-review canonical>'
$'pr-review-mention\tPR-Review-Mention\t.github/workflows/agent-ingress.yml\t<CANONICAL agent-ingress path>\tpr-review-mention\t.github/workflows/pr-review-mention.yml\tstandards/workflows/pr-review-mention.yml'
$'ci-failure-analyst\tCI-Failure-Analyst\t.github/workflows/agent-ingress.yml\t<CANONICAL agent-ingress path>\tci-failure-analyst\t.github/workflows/ci-failure-analyst.yml\t<legacy ci-failure-analyst canonical>'
```

> `<CANONICAL agent-ingress path>` and the three `<legacy … canonical>` cells
> resolve to wherever the org publishes the canonical `agent-ingress.yml` template
> (§9b) and each role's existing per-role canonical. They are left as markers
> because publishing the canonical template is the cross-repo step below.

### 9b. Canonical `agent-ingress.yml` template — publish is cross-repo (DEFERRED)

The canonical, per-repo-parameterized `agent-ingress.yml` template that markets'
copy must byte-match lives in the canonical stub repo
(`CANONICAL_STUB_REPO`, default `petry-projects/.github`). **Publishing it is a
write to another repo and cannot be done from `.github-private`.** The §3 content
is the pilot instance; the generalized template (repo-agnostic pins, the
role-superset `on:` union, adopter notes) is authored in the canonical repo by
its owner.

### 9c. Why in-repo activation is premature

- Adding the `STUB_REGISTRY` rows (§9a) before the canonical template exists
  makes `fleet_monitor.sh` compare markets' ingress against a `canonical_path`
  that 404s.
- ALIGNED verification via the role-path needs a **post-collapse** markets
  carrying `agent-ingress.yml`; today markets is pre-collapse, so every role
  would fall back to the legacy per-role path.

Activation lands after the markets PR merges and the canonical template is
published — this package hands both artifacts to that follow-up.

The Bats ingress checks use trimmed reusable snapshots. Changes to checked
inputs or concurrency declarations behind channel refs are not detected until
the snapshots are refreshed.

## 10. Companion issue for `petry-projects/markets` (prepared; filing is remaining)

`.github-private` dev-lead cannot open the markets PR, and this package cannot
file cross-repo either from here. The companion-issue body below is the committed
artifact; **filing it in `petry-projects/markets` is the remaining post-merge
step** (AC7 evidence is the filed issue link + the markets PR it drives).

```markdown
Title: [ADR-0007] Collapse per-role Class-1 stubs into agent-ingress.yml (pilot)

Body:
Implements ADR-0007 for this repo: collapse the 5 event-driven Class-1 agentic
caller stubs into a single `.github/workflows/agent-ingress.yml`.

Collapse package (source of truth, in .github-private):
docs/initiatives/agent-ingress-collapse-markets.md

## Do this
1. ADD `.github/workflows/agent-ingress.yml` with the exact content in §3 of the
   package.
2. DELETE the 5 per-role stubs: dev-lead.yml, pr-auto-review.yml, pr-review.yml,
   pr-review-mention.yml, ci-failure-analyst.yml.
3. Both changes in ONE commit / ONE PR (§8b).

## Before you merge (§8a gate)
- Re-read the branch ruleset; confirm none of the 5 roles is a required check
  (as of 2026-09-29 none is — see §6). If one has become required, apply the
  atomic ruleset rename in §8d in the same PR.
- Run the #1725 if-linter over agent-ingress.yml (every job if: is a pure event
  filter — §3a).
- The §4 job-level concurrency ruling is ratified (ADR-0010, accepted). Confirm
  validate-ingress-if.sh and validate-caller-inputs.sh pass on agent-ingress.yml.
- Keep the 6 carve-out stubs (§2b) and both required-gate stubs (§2c) untouched.

## Known follow-ups (do NOT bundle into this PR — §5)
- pr-review pin `@pr-review/stable` is a stale bare-tier channel — repoint after
  a `pr-review/v<MAJOR>-stable` channel is published.
- ci-failure-analyst pin is a bare SHA (`b585102…` # main) — repoint to a moving
  `ci-failure-analyst/v<MAJOR>-stable` channel.

## Rollback (§8c)
- Both half-landed states are safe (no required check depends on the 5 roles):
  revert the ingress add (State A) or restore the stubs (State B).
```

## 11. Honest gap list (what is NOT done, and why)

| Item | Status | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| markets PR (add ingress + delete 5 stubs) | **Not done — cannot be** | Cross-repo write; only markets' dev-lead can author it. Driven by §10. |
| Companion issue filed in markets | **Prepared, not filed** | Cross-repo write from `.github-private` not available in this run. Body is committed in §10. |
| Canonical `agent-ingress.yml` template published | **Deferred (§9b)** | Write to `petry-projects/.github`; cross-repo. |
| `STUB_REGISTRY` rows activated in fleet_monitor.sh | **Prepared, not applied (§9a)** | Would 404 against an unpublished canonical path and can't be ALIGNED-verified pre-collapse (§9c). |
| §4 job-level concurrency schema ruling | **Ratified — ADR-0010, accepted** | ADR-0010 admits bounded job-level `concurrency:`. §3 was re-rendered to the bounds (#2038), and §4b states the non-PR-event behavior change. |
| pin corrections (§5a/§5b) | **Named, not applied** | Behavior-preserving collapse must not change pins; separate follow-ups. |
| Dedicated baseline doc at the brief's cited path | **Does not exist (§1)** | Not fabricated; real baseline is the reference file + live stubs. |
