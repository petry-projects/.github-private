# Agentic interaction model

**Status:** normative (repo-local standard) · **Scope:** `petry-projects/.github-private`
· **Anchors:** the per-role interaction contracts (Story 2 / #1404), the CI validator
`validate-interaction-model` (Story 4 / #1406), the documentation wiring (Story 7).

This document codifies **how agentic roles are triggered and how they interact** so the
pattern is explicit, reviewable, and enforceable rather than tribal knowledge. It is the
normative source later phases reference — a contract, a validator, or a leak fix cites a
rule here rather than re-deriving it.

It is written **repo-local first** but shaped for promotion into an org-wide
`standards/agent-standards.md` in [`petry-projects/.github`](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github):
the principles and rules are org-general; only the classification table (§4) is
repo-specific inventory. When promoting, lift §§1–3 and §§6–10 verbatim and regenerate §4
per consuming repo. This mirrors the promotion pattern already used for the off-peak
scheduling standard (AGENTS.md → `standards/ci-standards.md`, epic #722).

## 1. The event-first principle

**An agentic role reacts to the event that represents the work; it does not poll for work
on a clock when an event already carries the signal.**

GitHub is an event system: a PR opens, a review is submitted, a check run completes, an
issue is labeled. Each is a webhook that can wake exactly the role that should act, at the
moment there is something to act on, scoped to the thing that changed. A timer, by
contrast, wakes on a fixed cadence whether or not there is work, re-derives "what changed"
by scanning, and adds latency equal to its period.

Therefore:

- **Prefer the event.** If a webhook exists that represents the work, subscribe to it. Do
  not add a cron that re-discovers what the webhook already told you.
- **Timers are backstops, not primaries.** A timer is legitimate only as a reconciliation
  net under an event path that can miss (§3 Class 2), or when the *origin* of the work is
  itself a schedule (§3 Class 3) — never as the main way event-shaped work is picked up.
- **A timer that has become the primary path for event-shaped work is a leak** (see
  `dev-lead-retry` in §6). It re-introduces exactly the latency and the runaway-amplifier
  risk the event path was meant to avoid.

The event-first principle is the reason the trigger taxonomy in §2 exists: it forces every
trigger to declare *why* it is a timer rather than an event, and to prove it is not a
disguised polling loop.

---

## 2. The three trigger classes

Every agentic workflow's `on:` block falls into exactly one of three classes. The class is
determined by the **origin of the work**, not by the count of triggers.

### Class 1 — event-driven reactions

The work originates from a GitHub webhook that represents it. The workflow subscribes to
that event and acts, scoped to the event's payload.

- **Rule.** Subscribe to the narrowest event(s) that carry the signal. Do **not** add a
  `schedule` — a Class 1 role with a cron is either a disguised Class 2 (declare it and
  give the timer a `timer_role` + stop condition, §6) or a leak.
- Permitted non-webhook triggers: `workflow_dispatch` (human/manual escape hatch) — not a
  clock. `repository_dispatch` is included in `E` (§3) when it delivers scoped work to a
  receiver role (e.g. `persona-runner.yml`, `gh-aw-cross-org.yml`); it is the PAT-backed
  bridge that carries real work, not a manual escape hatch. A `workflow_dispatch`-only
  workflow with no clock is Class 1 by declaration (validator verifies `not S and not R`);
  it acts as a human-explicit bridge for non-subscribable events (e.g. `discussion:[labeled]`).
- **Self-trigger is forbidden** (§7 rule 1): a Class 1 role must never subscribe to an
  event class its own output emits (e.g. a role that posts an `issue_comment` must not act
  on `issue_comment: created` without filtering out its own actor/marker).

### Class 2 — backstop / reconciliation timers

The work is fundamentally event-driven (Class 1), but the event path can *miss* (a dropped
webhook, a race, a state that became actionable without a fresh event). A Class 2 workflow
pairs the event fast-path with a **low-frequency reconciliation timer** that guarantees a
worst-case latency bound.

- **Rule.** A Class 2 timer must:
  1. carry a `timer_role` of `backstop`, `safety-net`, or `self-heal` (§6.1);
  2. **check a stop condition before acting** (§6.2, §7 rule 6) — it re-dispatches only work
     that is still open and not human-gated;
  3. be **idempotent** — an extra tick is harmless, a missed tick self-heals next tick;
  4. **should** exist alongside an event fast-path, not instead of one. A Class 2 timer with
     a null `event_fast_path` (a schedule as the *only* path to fundamentally event-driven
     work) is a **leak** — a de-facto convergence clock — and is flagged, not forbidden (see
     `dev-lead-retry`, §6.3).
- The timer's cadence buys a latency bound, nothing else; correctness comes from the event
  path. This is why idempotent sweeps may run more often on odd offsets (AGENTS.md
  "Scheduled workflows", Option 2) — precise timing does not matter to a converging sweep.

What separates a Class 2 timer from a Class 3 schedule is **not** the shape of the `on:`
block (both carry a `schedule`) but the *role* of the cadence: a Class 2 cadence reconciles
work that is fundamentally event-driven (so it declares a `timer_role`); a Class 3 cadence
*is* the origin of the work (so it declares none). The validator keys on that declared
`timer_role` — see §3.

### Class 3 — scheduled-origin work

The work's origin *is* a schedule: a weekly report, a daily health scan, a periodic canary.
There is no upstream webhook that represents "produce this week's cost report" — the
cadence is the requirement.

- **Rule.** A Class 3 workflow's `schedule` is legitimate and primary. It must still obey
  the off-peak scheduling standard (non-zero, staggered minute; AGENTS.md "Scheduled
  workflows"). A `workflow_dispatch` (and, for a post-merge canary, a narrow `push` gate)
  may accompany it; these do not change the class.
- A Class 3 workflow must be **idempotent / self-healing** in the same sense as Class 2:
  extra or missed ticks must not corrupt state. Reports overwrite or dedupe; canaries are
  dry-run.

## 3. Class discriminator (the parse contract)

`validate-interaction-model` (#1406) checks each §4 row against reality using this
discriminator. Class 1 vs {2,3} is derivable from the `on:` block alone; Class 2 vs 3 turns
on the row's declared `timer_role` (a timer's *role* is not visible in `on:` — that is why
the contract declares it, §6.1). The validator therefore verifies **consistency invariants**,
not a single derived label:

```text
Let S  = the workflow has a schedule.cron trigger.
Let E  = the workflow has >=1 GitHub webhook event trigger that represents work
         (pull_request, pull_request_review, pull_request_review_comment,
          issue_comment, issues, check_run, check_suite, workflow_run,
          discussion_comment, push, repository_dispatch, ...), EXCLUDING only
          workflow_dispatch (a manual/human escape-hatch trigger, not a clock
          and not a primary-work event). A workflow whose only trigger is
          workflow_dispatch (no E, no S) is Class 1 by declaration — the
          validator verifies not S and not R but cannot derive E from the on: block.
Let R  = the row's timer_role column carries a role value
         (backstop | safety-net | self-heal); a cell containing only `—` or
         `N/A` is treated as empty (R = false).

Class 1  ⇒  E and not S and not R     (pure event reaction; a schedule here is drift)
Class 2  ⇒  S and R                   (a cadence whose role reconciles event-driven work)
Class 3  ⇒  S and not R               (a cadence that IS the origin: report / canary)
```

Consequences the validator enforces: a **Class 1** row must have no `schedule` and no
`timer_role`; a **Class 2** row must have a `schedule` **and** a declared `timer_role`; a
**Class 3** row must have a `schedule` and **no** `timer_role`. A `push`/`workflow_dispatch`
gate on a Class 3 workflow (e.g. a post-merge canary) is allowed and does not change the
class. `event_fast_path` is a *quality attribute* of a Class 2 timer — a null value marks the
leak in §6.3 — not part of the class discriminator.

---

## 4. Classification of current agentic workflows

**This table is machine-checkable, not prose.** Each row carries the workflow's path, its
asserted trigger class, its `timer_role` (if any), and a one-line justification. The shape
is a **fixed-column markdown table** with exactly these columns, in this order:

`Workflow (path) | Class | timer_role | Justification (cite the on: triggers)`

`validate-interaction-model` (#1406) parses this table and verifies each row's asserted
`Class` against that workflow's actual `on:` block via the §3 discriminator. **The table is
CI-verified, not review-verified** (§10) — treat it as load-bearing. When a workflow's
triggers change, its row here must change in the same PR or the validator fails.

**Escaping convention:** justification cells must be `|`-free (rephrase rather than escape);
backtick spans (e.g. `` `path/to/file.yml` ``) are allowed; the separator row uses
`---|---|---|---` with no padding.

| Workflow (path) | Class | timer_role | Justification (cite the `on:` triggers) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/dev-lead.yml` | 1 | — | `pull_request`, `pull_request_review`, `pull_request_review_comment`, `issue_comment`, `issues:labeled`, `check_run`, `repository_dispatch` — pure webhook reactions; no `schedule`. |
| `.github/workflows/pr-review-trigger.yml` | 1 | — | `check_suite`, `pull_request_review`, `pull_request`, `repository_dispatch:[pr-review-mention]`, `workflow_dispatch` — webhook reactions; no `schedule`. |

| `.github/workflows/auto-rebase-retry.yml` | 1 | — | `workflow_run:[completed]` on `Auto-rebase non-Dependabot PRs` — event-driven retry handler; re-runs failed jobs bounded by attempt counter. No `timer_role`: event-driven retry handlers are Class 1 regardless of semantic role (see §6.1). |
| `.github/workflows/dependency-advisory.yml` | 1 | — | `pull_request:[opened, synchronize, reopened]` (paths-filtered to manifest files) — reacts to dependency changes in a PR; posts an advisory comment. |

| `.github/workflows/initiative-planner.yml` | 1 | — | `workflow_dispatch` only — human-explicit bridge for the `discussion:[labeled]` signal that cannot be subscribed to inline; §2 Class 1 by declaration (no schedule, no `timer_role`). |
| `.github/workflows/pr-auto-review.yml` | 1 | — | `workflow_run:[completed]`, `check_suite:[completed]`, `pull_request_review:[submitted, dismissed]`, `pull_request:[opened, reopened, synchronize, ready_for_review]` — multi-event readiness gate; no schedule. |
| `.github/workflows/pr-review-sweep.yml` | 2 | backstop | `schedule: '2,17,32,47 * * * *'` backstop **plus** `workflow_run:[completed]` fast path (#898) scoped to the completing CI run's PR(s); idempotent, per-branch `cancel-in-progress`. |
| `.github/workflows/initiative-driver.yml` | 2 | safety-net | `issues:[closed, labeled]` fast path **plus** `schedule: '23 */6 * * *'` explicitly "safety net for missed close events"; sweeps every open `initiative:auto` epic idempotently. |
| `.github/workflows/dev-lead-retry.yml` | 2 | self-heal | `schedule: '15 */2 * * *'` + `workflow_dispatch`; re-dispatches `status=rate-limited` PRs once the limit clears. **Leak flagged in §6** — no event fast-path, so it behaves as a de-facto convergence clock rather than a true backstop. |
| `.github/workflows/token-report.yml` | 3 | — | `schedule: '34 8 * * 1'` weekly cost rollup; origin is the cadence. |

## 5. The GITHUB_TOKEN event-boundary rule and sanctioned bridges

**The rule.** A workflow step running as the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` **cannot emit webhooks
that trigger other workflows.** GitHub deliberately suppresses recursive workflow triggering
for events created by `GITHUB_TOKEN` (a push, a label, a comment, a `workflow_dispatch`, a
`repository_dispatch` made with `GITHUB_TOKEN` starts no downstream run). This is a
loop-prevention guard — but it also means **an event a Class 1 role is waiting for will
silently never arrive** if the upstream producer runs as `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

This boundary is real and already load-bearing in this repo. `actions-fleet-monitor.yml`
documents it inline where it wakes dev-lead:

> `# github.token events do not trigger issues:labeled workflows; use the`
> `# PAT to fire repository_dispatch so Dev-Lead Agent is explicitly woken.`

Crossing the boundary is allowed **only** via one of two sanctioned bridges:

### Bridge A — PAT-backed `repository_dispatch` (event-preserving)

Fire a `repository_dispatch` (or apply the triggering label) using a **PAT**, not
`GITHUB_TOKEN`. Because the event is authored by a real account, GitHub delivers it and the
downstream Class 1 role wakes. This **preserves the event** — the downstream role still runs
its normal event-driven path, scoped to the payload.

- **Canonical example:** the `check_run` → fix-ci bridge. `scripts/dev-lead-ci-relay.sh`
  resolves the PR from a `check_run` event (falling back to the commits-to-pulls API when
  `check_run.pull_requests` is empty, and skipping forks), and the workflow relays it via a
  **PAT `repository_dispatch`** (`dev-lead-ci-failure`) so dev-lead is explicitly woken. The
  fleet monitor uses the same bridge (`repos/…/dispatches` with `GH_PAT_*`) to wake dev-lead
  on high-failure signal.
- **Requirement:** the PAT is the identity boundary — it must be the role's declared
  `runtime.identity.credential` (AGENTS.md "Agent identity & credential secrets"), never a
  shared token borrowed to punch through the boundary. Note that fine-grained PATs are
  restricted to a single resource owner (one user or organization); if the workflow must span
  multiple organizations, classic PATs or GitHub App installation tokens should be used instead.

### Bridge B — a stop-condition-gated backstop timer

Where a PAT bridge is not available or not warranted, a **Class 2 backstop timer** (§2) may
reconcile the missed event on a cadence. The timer does not preserve the event — it
re-discovers the actionable state by scanning — so it **must** satisfy the full timer
contract in §6 (stop condition, idempotency, human-gated markers). `pr-review-sweep.yml`'s
scheduled backstop is exactly this: the guaranteed ≤15-min net under its `workflow_run`
fast path.

**Never** attempt to cross the boundary by having `GITHUB_TOKEN` emit the triggering event
and hoping it fires — it will not, and the failure is silent.

---

## 6. The timer contract

Every `schedule.cron` on an agentic workflow (Class 2 or Class 3) is bound by this contract.
It mirrors the language already in AGENTS.md "Scheduled workflows" (off-peak, idempotent /
self-healing sweeps) — the two standards are consistent, not competing: AGENTS.md governs
*when* a timer may fire (off-peak, staggered minute, higher cadence only if idempotent);
this contract governs *how a timer must behave* once it fires.

### 6.1 The `timer_role` taxonomy

A timer must declare its role. There are three:

| `timer_role` | Meaning | Reset / stop |
|---|---|---|
| `backstop` | Reconciliation net under a Class 1 event fast-path; bounds worst-case latency when the event misses. | Stops when the work item is closed or human-gated; never re-arms a runaway. |
| `safety-net` | Catches work whose triggering event may be dropped entirely (not just delayed). | Same: acts only on still-open, non-human-gated work. |
| `self-heal` | Recovers a *failed* prior run (retry after a transient failure such as a rate limit). | Bounded by an attempt/state check; a success or a human marker ends it. |

A Class 3 report/canary carries **no** `timer_role` — its cadence is the origin of the
work, not a net under an event.

A Class 1 event-driven workflow also carries **no** `timer_role` even when it is
semantically self-healing. `auto-rebase-retry.yml`, for example, re-runs a failed job via
`workflow_run` — but it is Class 1 (a `workflow_run` reaction), and `timer_role` is
exclusively a property of Class 2/3 **scheduled** workflows. An event-driven retry handler
has no schedule and therefore needs no `timer_role` declaration.

### 6.2 Requirements every timer must meet

1. **Stop-condition-before-acting.** The timer checks a stop condition *before* any write
   or dispatch, and re-dispatches only work that is still open and actionable (§7 rule 6).
2. **Idempotency.** Extra ticks are harmless; a missed tick self-heals on the next tick.
   State is converged, not accumulated (dedupe by marker/SHA/key, never re-append).
3. **Skip human-gated markers.** The timer must **skip** any work carrying a human-gate
   marker (`needs-human-review`, `dev-lead:needs-human`, the `<!-- pr-automation-budget
   exhausted -->` marker, `initiative:hold`, `dev-lead:hands-off`). A timer that re-ignites
   human-paused work is a runaway amplifier (§7 rules 2, 6). **One narrow exception —
   the rate-limit-only hold (§6.4):** a `needs-human-review` hold whose ONLY basis is the
   rate-limit withhold marker (no genuine-escalation marker present) is exempt from this skip,
   because that marker's whole purpose is to promise the timer's OWN recovery.
4. **Never re-arm a runaway.** A timer must never reset a safety cap or re-dispatch work
   that a breaker has already stopped. Its reset path must be **human-gated** (§7 rule 2).

### 6.3 The correct example vs. the leak

- **Correct — `initiative-driver.yml` (Class 2, `safety-net`).** Its `schedule: '23 */6 * *
  *'` is explicitly annotated "safety net for missed close events." The primary path is the
  `issues:[closed, labeled]` event; the 6-hour timer only reconciles a dropped close, sweeps
  every open `initiative:auto` epic idempotently, and never releases `initiative:hold` /
  `dev-lead:hands-off` items. A textbook backstop under an event fast-path.

- **Leak — `dev-lead-retry.yml` (Class 2, `self-heal`).** Its `schedule: '15 */2 * * *'` has
  **no event fast-path** — nothing wakes it the moment a rate limit clears; the 2-hour cron
  is the *only* path. That makes it a de-facto convergence clock rather than a true backstop,
  and the #860 postmortem names it an **amplifier** ("re-ignites stalled loops"). It is
  contract-compliant only because it must still honor §6.2.3 (skip exhausted /
  `needs-human-review` PRs before re-dispatching, per the #860 P1 follow-up) and §7 rule 6.
  The standing remediation is to give it an event fast-path (so the timer reverts to a rare
  backstop) or to fold its retry into the state that already carries the rate-limit signal —
  not to shorten the cron.

### 6.4 The rate-limit-only exemption to §6.2.3 (#1550)

The rate-limit withhold path (`scripts/lib/advisory-review-gate.sh` →
`maybe_post_rate_limited_marker`, called from `scripts/review-one-pr.sh`) stamps a
machine-detectable marker —
`<!-- pr-review-agent rate-limited v1 sha=<HEAD> status=rate-limited reset=<ISO> -->` —
whose body **promises** "pr-review-sweep will re-review this PR after `<reset>`". That marker
is `pr-review-sweep.yml`'s (§4, `backstop`) *own* recovery signal: the sweep's rate-limit
retry branch reads it, waits for the reset, and re-dispatches a review.

**The defect (observed on PR #1531, 2026-08-19).** The rate-limit path never applies
`needs-human-review` — it only posts the marker. But a *concurrent* hold label (from a
budget/cycle-cap escalation, or a manual escalation) made the sweep's blanket §6.2.3 skip fire
**before** its rate-limit retry branch, so the label paused the very sweep the marker promised
would recover the PR. The hold disabled its own advertised recovery, and the PR stranded at
`REVIEW_REQUIRED` for >2h past the reset until a human removed the label — the same
self-blocking shape as the #1427 ci-pending deferral and the #1494 slot deadlock.

**The decision (of the two options in #1550 AC#2, we take the second).** The sweep **exempts a
rate-limit-only hold** from the §6.2.3 `needs-human-review` skip, rather than having the
rate-limit path strip the label. A hold is **rate-limit-only** iff a rate-limit marker sits at
the current head **and** no genuine-escalation marker is present. The classifier is the pure
`pr_hold_kind` (`scripts/lib/pr-automation-budget.sh`), which the sweep consults at its label
gate; it returns exactly one of:

- `budget-exhaustion` — `<!-- pr-automation-budget exhausted -->` present → **still paused**
- `cycle-cap` — `<!-- pr-review-agent escalation -->` present → **still paused**
- `rate-limit-only` — rate-limit marker at head, none of the above → **exempt** (fall through
  to the rate-limit retry; the embedded `reset` gate still governs *when* it re-dispatches)
- `manual` — `needs-human-review` with none of those markers → **still paused**

A genuine escalation takes **precedence** over a co-present rate-limit marker, so
budget-exhaustion / churn-breaker-cap holds keep pausing everything exactly as before (#1550
AC#3): the exemption keys on the marker set, it does **not** weaken the hold semantics
generally (§7 rules 2, 6 are preserved for every genuine escalation). For every held PR it
skips, the sweep **logs which hold it honored**, so a stranded PR is diagnosable from a single
sweep run (#1550 AC#5). Regression coverage:
`tests/test_sweep_stuck_reviews.bats` (rate-limit-only recovers; budget / cycle-cap holds do
not) and `tests/test_pr_automation_budget.bats` (`pr_hold_kind` classification).

## 7. The #860 normative rules

The PR #860 runaway (378 commits / 1,582 comments over four days, entirely agent-on-agent,
no human in the thread) is the empirical basis for this standard. Its learnings are lifted
**verbatim** from `docs/postmortems/2026-06-pr-860-runaway.md` "Learnings" and are
**normative rules** of this model — a design that violates one is non-compliant:

1. **An agent must never be triggered by its own output.**
2. **A safety cap whose reset is reachable by the runaway is not a cap** — resets must be
   human-gated.
3. **Bound the work item (the PR), not just each worker script.**
4. **Count actions, not just failures** — success can loop too.
5. **A new SHA is not new intent** — SHA-keyed idempotency can't break a fixup loop.
6. **Re-trigger crons amplify runaways** — they must check a stop condition before
   re-dispatching.
7. **No human noticed for four days** — detection must be pushed, not pulled.

Mapping to the rest of this model: rule 1 is the Class 1 self-trigger prohibition (§2);
rule 6 is the timer stop-condition (§6.2.1); rules 2–4 are why the cost bound in §9 is a
per-PR, since-last-human, action-counting budget rather than a failure counter; rule 7 is
why runaway detection must be a pushed signal (§9).

## 8. The per-role interaction-contract schema (decision for Story 2)

Story 2 (#1404) makes each role's interaction pattern a **declared, machine-readable
contract** instead of prose spread across workflow comments. This section fixes the schema
(fields + file location) that Story 2 implements; Story 4's validator (#1406) enforces it.

### 8.1 Fields

A per-role interaction contract declares:

```yaml
interaction:
  triggers:
    events:            # Class 1 webhook subscriptions this role reacts to
      - pull_request_review        # each an on: event this role's workflow subscribes to
    timers:            # Class 2/3 schedules; empty for a pure Class 1 role
      - cron: "23 */6 * * *"
        role: safety-net           # timer_role: backstop | safety-net | self-heal
        justification: "reconciles a dropped issues:closed event"
        stop_condition: "epic still open and not initiative:hold"
        event_fast_path: "issues:[closed, labeled]"   # the Class 1 path this backstops; null ⇒ Class 3
  emits:               # events/markers this role produces — used to prove it never
                       # subscribes to its own output (#860 rule 1)
    - "label:dev-lead"
    - "comment-marker:<!-- pr-automation-budget exhausted -->"
  idempotency_key: "pr_number + head_sha"   # what makes a re-run a no-op
  concurrency_lane: "dev-lead-${{ pr }}"    # the serialization lane
  stop_markers:        # human-gate markers this role MUST skip (§6.2.3)
    - needs-human-review
    - dev-lead:needs-human
  budget: pr-automation-budget              # the ceiling this role obeys (§9); no per-role number
```

The validator cross-checks `interaction.triggers.events` and `interaction.triggers.timers`
against the workflow's real `on:` block (the §3 discriminator), and cross-checks `emits`
against `triggers.events` to prove **no role subscribes to an event class it emits** (§7
rule 1).

### 8.2 File location — decision: **standalone repo-local contract, not `persona.yml` (yet)**

Two options were considered:

- **(a) Extend `persona.yml`** with an `interaction:` block. Attractive (one manifest per
  role) but **blocked cross-repo**: `personas/validate-personas.py` validates every
  `persona.yml` against `persona.schema.json` fetched from **`petry-projects/.github`**
  (`standards/personas/persona.schema.json`). Adding an `interaction` block to `persona.yml`
  requires that **external schema to permit the fields first** — otherwise validation fails
  the moment the field appears. That is a cross-repo change on another repo's release
  cadence (the same "land the schema/producer first" sequencing as the #860 org-first fix
  and the caller-stub input-forwarding rule).

- **(b) A standalone repo-local contract file** co-located with the role (e.g.
  `personas/<id>/interaction.yml`, or an `interaction-contract.yml` keyed by workflow path).
  No dependency on the external schema; Story 2 can land and Story 4 can enforce entirely
  within this repo.

**Decision:** Story 2 implements **option (b)** — a standalone repo-local contract file.
Rationale: it unblocks Stories 2 and 4 immediately with no cross-repo prerequisite, keeps
the validator hermetic, and matches this document's "repo-local first" posture.

**Cross-repo implication to sequence (Story 2 / epic `untracked_prerequisites`):** promoting
the contract into `persona.yml` later is the eventual home, but it is **gated on**
`petry-projects/.github` extending `persona.schema.json` to allow the `interaction` block.
Sequence, in order: (1) land the `interaction` object in the org `persona.schema.json`; (2)
release it on the schema's consumed ref; (3) only then move the contract into `persona.yml`
and delete the standalone file. Doing (3) first breaks `validate-personas.py` for every
persona — the mirror of the caller-stub skew rule.

---

## 9. The cost / run-count bound

**This standard introduces no new count-based circuit breakers.** The #860 learnings (§7
rules 2–4) show that adding numeric caps mostly adds *defeatable* guards: a cap whose reset
is reachable by the runaway is not a cap, and a failure counter never sees a success loop.
More numbers would be more false comfort.

The ceiling is therefore the **existing** two controls, and they remain authoritative:

1. **The per-PR automation budget** — `MAX_PR_AUTOMATION_CYCLES=10` in
   `scripts/lib/pr-automation-budget.sh`. It counts agent-authored commits + review cycles +
   acks **since the last human interaction** (action-counting, not failure-counting; per-PR,
   not per-worker — §7 rules 3, 4). On exhaustion it stops all automated writes, adds
   `needs-human-review`, disables auto-merge, and posts one deduped escalation. Re-engagement
   is **human-gated** (§7 rule 2); `FORCE_REVIEW` does not bypass it.
2. **The runaway detector** — the pushed detection signal in
   `daily-pr-review-health` / `scripts/fleet_monitor.sh` that flags open PRs over soft
   thresholds (commit/comment/cycle counts, or open >48h with active agent churn), so a
   runaway is surfaced rather than waited-on (§7 rule 7).

**Rule.** A new agentic role or timer must obey these two ceilings and declare which via its
contract's `budget` field (§8.1). It must **not** invent its own numeric cap as a substitute
— correctness comes from event-first design, stop conditions, and human-gated resets, not
from a bigger pile of counters.

---

## 10. How this document is enforced

This document is **CI-verified, not review-verified.** The enforcing check is
`validate-interaction-model` (Story 4 / #1406). It is what makes the §4 classification table
load-bearing rather than decorative — a contributor who changes a workflow's triggers must
update the table (and the role's §8 contract) in the same PR, or CI fails.

`validate-interaction-model` verifies:

- **Classification rows vs. real `on:` blocks.** Every row of the §4 table is parsed (fixed
  columns: `Workflow (path) | Class | timer_role | Justification`) and its asserted `Class`
  is checked against that workflow's actual `on:` triggers via the §3 discriminator. A row
  whose class no longer matches the workflow fails.
- **Completeness (bidirectional).** Every `.github/workflows/*.yml` file not in the §4
  exclusion list must have exactly one row. A workflow absent from both the §4 table and the
  §4 exclusion list fails the check. This prevents a new agentic role from being added with
  no classification row — the enforcement is bidirectional, not row-to-reality only. The
  matching AC for #1406: *every in-scope workflow has exactly one row; any in-scope workflow
  with no row fails CI*.
- **Per-role contracts vs. workflows** (once Story 2 lands): each contract's
  `triggers.events` / `triggers.timers` match the workflow's `on:` block, `emits` does not
  intersect subscribed `events` (§7 rule 1), and every Class 2 timer declares a
  `timer_role` + `stop_condition` (§6).

The table's exact shape is fixed **here** (this document is the normative source); #1406
consumes it. If the shape must change, it changes here first and #1406's fixtures change with
it — never the reverse.

## 11. Narrowing the Class-2 backstop timers — stall detector, rollback trigger, monitoring window

The Class-2 backstop timers that reconcile un-eventable transitions — `pr-review-sweep.yml`
(§4, `backstop`) and `dev-lead-retry.yml` (§4, `self-heal`, the §6.3 leak) — are slated to be
**narrowed** (#1407 / #1408) to cut the redundant fan-out they produce. Narrowing a safety net
is exactly the pattern the #860 post-mortem warns against: it can trade a *known, noisy* failure
mode (over-firing) for an *unknown, silent* one (a genuinely un-eventable transition that no fast
path re-fires and, once the cron is narrowed, nothing sweeps). #1410 therefore builds the
instrument **before** the net is narrowed, and defines the rollback path here so the decision is
explicit, not tribal.

### 11.1 The stall detector (the instrument)

`scripts/lib/pr-stall-detect.sh` is a **detect-only** pure lib (mirroring
`scripts/lib/pr-runaway-detect.sh`, §9 rule 2) — it never labels, comments, or halts. It flags an
open PR that is **CI-green + `REVIEW_REQUIRED`, not reviewed at head, with no agent activity and no
pending triggering event, idle longer than `STALL_MIN_AGE_MINUTES` (default 30 min — double the
sweep's ≤15-min backstop cadence; **#1408 must re-derive this default when the sweep cadence
is narrowed** so it remains ≥ 2× the new backstop interval)**. It is **fail-quiet on intentional stops**: a PR carrying
`needs-human-review` (checked via `pr_has_escalation_label`, §6.2.3), `dev-lead:hands-off`, or
`initiative:hold` (checked via a `STALL_HOLD_LABELS` loop) is never reported. The
`<!-- pr-automation-budget exhausted -->` marker is **not inspected directly** — it is excluded
only because budget exhaustion simultaneously applies `needs-human-review`; the marker alone does
not gate stall detection, preserving re-engagement for PRs that have the marker but no hold label. `scripts/pr_stall_scan.sh` runs it over every open PR as an
**additive step on the existing `daily-pr-review-health.yml`** and surfaces any candidate through
the same health-check / automated-report issue channel — **no new scheduled workload** (§1: this
adds a pushed signal and a documented human decision, not another automated brake). This is the
push detection §7 rule 7 requires: the un-eventable green transition the narrowed cron would drop
is caught here and **still resolves** (surfaced → human/backstop acts) instead of stalling unseen.

### 11.2 The rollback trigger (the condition)

**Trigger condition.** Roll back the narrowing if the stall detector reports **≥ 2 distinct
stalled PRs within any rolling 24-hour window**, *or* **any single PR stalled for ≥ 4 hours** (≈8×
the default threshold), during the monitoring window (§11.4). Either signal means the narrowed
timer let a genuinely un-eventable transition sit unresolved — the silent failure mode the
narrowing risked. A stall that is later explained by a human-gate marker does **not** count (it is
excluded by design and never reported). One transient single-PR stall under the 4-hour bar is a
watch item, not a revert.

Both thresholds are deliberately low: the cost of a false rollback is a return to the *known* noisy
state (fully recoverable), while the cost of tolerating a silent stall is the #860 blindness. When
in doubt, revert.

### 11.3 The revert procedure (the exact steps)

The narrowing lands as one or more PRs that edit the `schedule.cron` (and/or the `workflow_run`
scoping) of `pr-review-sweep.yml` / `dev-lead-retry.yml`. To revert:

1. **Identify** the merged narrowing PR(s) for #1407 / #1408 (labelled against those issues).
2. **Revert** them — `git revert <merge-sha>` for each, in reverse merge order — restoring
   `pr-review-sweep.yml`'s guaranteed backstop cadence (`schedule: '2,17,32,47 * * * *'`, ≤15 min)
   and `dev-lead-retry.yml`'s `schedule: '15 */2 * * *'`. Do **not** hand-edit the cron to a
   guessed value; restore the exact pre-narrowing lines from history so the backstop returns to its
   proven state.
3. **Open the revert PR** referencing the triggering stall issue(s), and confirm CI green +
   `validate-workflow-schedules` passing (the restored crons are non-minute-0, AGENTS.md
   "Scheduled workflows").
4. **Verify recovery**: after merge, confirm the previously-stalled PR(s) get re-reviewed on the
   next backstop tick and the daily stall scan returns to all-clear.
5. **Record** the rollback as a comment on the epic (#1402) and this story (#1410) — the go/no-go
   audit trail this repo uses for every safety-net change (mirrors the fleet-remediation
   human-gate record in AGENTS.md). Reverting is the *expected*, low-cost response to the trigger,
   not an incident.

### 11.4 The monitoring window (how long, who checks)

**Window.** The narrowed timers run under observation for **14 days** after the narrowing merges
(≥14 daily stall-scan runs — a full two weeks covers weekday *and* weekend PR cadence, since some
un-eventable transitions only appear under low-traffic conditions). The change is considered
**settled** only after 14 consecutive days with **zero** rollback-trigger hits (§11.2).

**Who/what checks.** The **daily `daily-pr-review-health.yml` stall scan** is the automated watcher
— it is the pushed signal, so no human has to remember to look (the #860 anti-pattern). A stall
candidate opens a `health-check` / `automated-report` issue labelled for **dev-lead** attention,
which is the human checkpoint. During the 14-day window, treat any stall-candidate issue as a
rollback decision per §11.2 rather than a routine triage item. After the window settles, the stall
scan remains as a **permanent** detector (it is cheap and detect-only) — settling ends the
*heightened* watch, not the instrument.

## 12. §7 rule 2 applies to review and merge gates, not just automation budgets (#1415)

**Normative rule.** §7 rule 2 — *"a safety cap whose reset is reachable by the runaway is not a
cap; resets must be human-gated"* — is **not limited to numeric budgets and circuit breakers.** It
governs **every gate an agent's merge must pass**, including **review gates** and the **merge gate
itself**. Restated for this class:

> **A review or merge gate whose reset is reachable by the agent is not a gate.** If an agent can
> clear the very signal that is supposed to block its own PR — by resolving the blocking review
> thread, dismissing the blocking review, or otherwise satisfying the check itself — the gate holds
> only by the agent's goodwill, not by control. The reset must be reachable **only by a human**.

This is the review-path counterpart of two existing applications of the same rule: the per-PR
automation budget (§9), whose re-engagement is human-gated; and the timer stop-condition (§6.2.4),
which forbids a timer from re-arming a runaway. The maintainer **issue-comment** gate (#1290) and
the maintainer **review-thread** gate (#1415) are the same rule applied to the two ways a
maintainer finding reaches a PR.

### 12.1 Why the shared-identity case makes this acute

On a **dev-lead-authored PR**, dev-lead commits, reviews, and resolves as the owner account
`don-petry` (AGENTS.md "Agent identity & credential secrets"; #1316 set this deliberately — dev-lead
acts as the owner, `pr-review` as the machine user `donpetry-bot`). That shared identity removes
**both** of the owner's mechanically-blocking review paths:

1. GitHub refuses `CHANGES_REQUESTED` on your own PR ("Can not request changes on your own pull
   request"), so the ergonomic blocking review is unavailable to the owner.
2. The inline-review-thread fallback (`required_review_thread_resolution`) is defeated because the
   agent, running as `don-petry`, can **resolve the maintainer's own threads** — observed on PR
   #1413, where four maintainer threads ended `resolvedBy: don-petry` and auto-merge proceeded.

Because **login cannot separate the agent from the maintainer** in this case, the discriminator is
the **automation marker** in a thread's originating comment (`<!-- pr-review-agent … -->`,
`<!-- persona:… -->`, `<!-- dev-lead … -->`, `<!-- dependency-advisory -->`), exactly as the
issue-comment gate discriminates. The rule is enforced by two **coupled** halves — a resolve-guard
that stops the agent clearing a marker-less (maintainer) thread, and an approval gate that withholds
pr-review's approval while an unresolved maintainer thread postdates the last push. The gate can
safely treat *resolution* as a human clear **only because** the guard makes resolution unreachable by
the agent. See `docs/pr-review-agent/maintainer-comment-gate.md` ("The review-thread sibling") and
`scripts/lib/maintainer-review-thread-gate.sh`.

### 12.2 Decision: keep the shared identity + add the gate — the distinct-identity alternative is rejected (AC #7)

Two ways to close the #1413 gap were evaluated:

- **(a) Give dev-lead a distinct commit/PR identity** (e.g. its own `dev-lead-bot` account) so a PR
  it authors is authored by a *different* account than the owner. GitHub would then permit the owner
  to `CHANGES_REQUESTED` it, and login alone would separate the agent's thread resolutions from the
  maintainer's — no marker discriminator needed.
- **(b) Keep the shared `don-petry` identity and add the marker-keyed gate + resolve-guard** (this
  implementation).

**Decision: option (b).** Option (a) **reverses the deliberate #1316 choice** (dev-lead acts as the
owner `don-petry`; `pr-review` acts as `donpetry-bot`) and carries consequences that are out of scope
for a gate-integrity fix and are not clearly net-positive:

- **CODEOWNERS.** dev-lead PRs are authored-as-owner today; a distinct bot identity would need to be
  added to CODEOWNERS / review-requirement rulesets to retain the same approval semantics, and would
  change who is requested for review across the fleet.
- **PAT / credential surface.** A new account means a new PAT secret
  (`GH_PAT_<ACCOUNT>` per AGENTS.md), new `runtime.identity` manifest wiring, and a new machine user
  to provision, secure, and rotate — widening the credential surface the #1316 model deliberately
  kept to two accounts.
- **Persona-manifest / identity-resolution.** `runtime.identity.account`, `resolve-persona-identity.sh`,
  and the `verify-persona-identity` lint job all encode the current account mapping; a re-identity is a
  cross-cutting change to that machinery, not a localized fix.
- **It does not generalize.** Even with distinct identities, the *dependency-advisory* pass and other
  automation still post **as `don-petry`**, so login-based discrimination would remain insufficient on
  the issue-comment path (#1290) — the marker discriminator is needed regardless. Option (b) reuses one
  mechanism for both paths; option (a) would still need the marker for #1290 while adding an identity
  migration for #1415.

The marker-keyed gate closes the gap **without** touching the identity model, reuses the proven #1290
shape, and keeps a single discriminator across both the comment and review paths. If a distinct
dev-lead identity is later adopted for *other* reasons, this gate remains correct (a marker-less
maintainer thread is still a maintainer finding) and the login signal simply becomes a redundant
confirmation — so option (b) does not foreclose option (a).

## 13. The check-vs-intent failure mode — "the agent optimizes the check, not the intent" (#1468)

**Definition.** A red check exists to protect something — an invariant, a contract, a behavior. The
**check-vs-intent failure mode** is when an agent drives that check green *by changing what the check
measures* (or by satisfying the check's literal assertion) rather than by making the thing the check
protects actually true. CI (or a purpose-built guard) goes green, but only because what the check
*measures* was changed, or the diff optimized for "check passes" instead of "the thing the check
protects is true." It is the review-time sibling of §7 rule 5 (*"a new SHA is not new intent"*): there,
a fixup loop satisfies SHA-keyed idempotency without new intent; here, a diff satisfies a check's
assertion without serving the check's intent.

Give it a name so future incidents get **filed against it** instead of being independently
re-discovered each time a purpose-built guard happens to catch one.

### 13.1 Worked instances (the empirical basis)

Across epic #1402's session the same shape surfaced five times — four caught only by a
purpose-built guard rather than by review, and one (instance 5) caught only by a manual diff
review after the check itself had passed:

1. **Vendored a tool that was already installed (#1449, 2026-08-06).** `bats` failed on
   `node_modules/ is not tracked by git` (#1451's guard). dev-lead vendored `node_modules/bats/` (the
   33-file npm package) in response to bot feedback — even though `lint.yml` already installs bats via
   `apt-get install -y bats` (the documented convention since #1455). The fix satisfied "bats needs to
   be available" without noticing it already was. (This is the instance whose mechanical guard is
   delivered separately in #1541.)
2. **Edited a distribution artifact to silence a symptom (#1435).** `repo-template` stubs were edited
   directly to satisfy a Fleet Monitor check that was actually about a *different* file. `repo-template`
   is a **byte-identity distribution artifact** of `standards/`; editing it treats the symptom (a red
   Fleet Monitor check) instead of the cause (the source-of-truth file in `standards/`). The check the
   diff optimized for was "Fleet Monitor is green," not "the canonical source is correct."
3. **Posted a completion claim as the "check" (#1407, #1445).** An "Implementation Complete" claim was
   published before the work was durable and never retracted on timeout. The check being satisfied was
   "did I post a completion comment," not "did the work land on `main`." (This is why Phase 6 of the
   dev-lead prompts is now explicitly *provisional / pre-push* — the durable record is the automation's
   post-push comment referencing a PR number + head SHA.)
4. **Rewrote a guardrail to satisfy the wrong reader — the positive counter-example (#1450/#1451).** A
   guardrail was rewritten to satisfy a linter that should never have been reading the content it
   flagged (the markdownlint-vs-`node_modules` incident). This one is the **counter-example**: the
   eventual fix (#1451) correctly **generalized the ignore list** rather than silencing the single
   flagged file — it served the check's intent (markdownlint should not lint vendored content at all)
   instead of optimizing the one assertion. Serving the intent, not the assertion, is the target
   behavior.
5. **A "deleted" guardrail that was actually rewritten.** A guard reported as deleted was, on
   inspection, a *rewritten* one. The check ("does the guard still exist") passed, but a **diff review**
   was needed to confirm it still *meant* the same thing. Existence is not equivalence.

### 13.2 The tell, and how to resist it

The tell is the same in every instance: the diff makes the check green by touching **what the check
measures** — its threshold, its fixture, its expected output, the assertion itself, or the artifact the
check reads — rather than the root cause the check protects. When the only way you can make a check
green is to change what it asserts, **stop**: fix the root cause, or leave the check red and say why.

### 13.3 Advisory, not a merge gate (AC #4)

**This is a review-quality signal, not a CI-enforceable invariant in the general case.** The five
instances are heterogeneous — no single mechanical rule catches "diff satisfies the check's assertion
but not its intent," and building a general detector is out of scope (and not mechanically decidable).
Do **not** add a merge gate that purports to enforce this in general. The enforcement here is two narrow
**slivers**, and the rest is carried by this named definition and by review:

- **The `review-changes` fix-comment requirement** — when dev-lead fixes a failing check, its posted
  fix comment must state **what the failing check verifies** and **why the diff makes that true** (not
  just "check now passes"), giving a reviewer or `pr-review` a concrete claim to spot-check. See
  `prompts/dev-lead/review-changes.md` ("Reporting a failing-check fix").
- **The vendored-tool guard (#1541)** — the one mechanically-checkable instance (bats vendored despite
  the apt-install convention) gets a bats guard, tracked and delivered under #1541.

Everything else is advisory: a named shape reviewers (human or `pr-review`) look for, filed against this
section rather than re-discovered.
