# PR Review Agent Workflow Failure Investigation

**Date:** 2026-04-28  
**Investigation Type:** Automated scheduled task  
**Scope:** Recent PR Review Agent workflow failures in `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml`

## Executive Summary

The PR Review Agent workflow has been **consistently failing since 2026-04-26** (6 consecutive failures). Root cause identified: **GitHub App token incompatibility with `@me` search queries in `list-prs.sh`**.

GitHub App tokens lack user identity, so the `@me` alias used in PR enumeration fails silently or returns no results, preventing the workflow from finding any PRs to review.

## Failure Timeline

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue: `@me` Doesn't Work with GitHub App Tokens

**Location:** `scripts/list-prs.sh`, lines 22 and 31

```bash
# Line 22: This fails with GitHub App tokens
authored=$(gh search prs \
  --state open \
  --author "@me" \
  --draft=false \
  --limit 100 \
  --json url \
  --jq '.[].url')

# Line 31: This also fails
review_requested=$(gh search prs \
  --state open \
  --review-requested "@me" \
  --draft=false \
  --checks success \
  --limit 100 \
  --json url \
  --jq '.[].url')
```

**Why it fails:**
- GitHub App tokens represent a **bot account without a user identity**
- The `@me` alias resolves to the authenticated user (which doesn't exist for app tokens)
- `gh search prs --author "@me"` fails or returns empty results
- The workflow continues but has zero PRs to review
- Likely exits early with no errors logged

### Evidence

**Prior fix in `fix-stuck-prs.sh` (commit bff0e4c):**

The same issue was identified and fixed in the `fix-stuck-prs.sh` script on 2026-04-25:

```bash
# OLD (didn't work with GitHub App):
--author "@me"

# NEW (works with GitHub App):
--author "don-petry"
```

Commit message: _"GitHub App tokens don't have user identity, so @me search doesn't work. Use explicit 'don-petry' author instead to find PRs to fix."_

**The same fix was never applied to `list-prs.sh`**, explaining why the PR Review workflow fails while fix-stuck-prs has been fixed.

### Timeline of Changes

1. **2026-04-26 01:51:21Z** — Last successful pr-review.yml run
2. **2026-04-26 01:51:21Z** — (unknown event) — GitHub App token setup likely moved to primary auth
3. **2026-04-26 02:15:18Z** — First pr-review.yml failure (6 minutes later)
4. **2026-04-25 19:18:17Z** — Commit bff0e4c fixed `@me` → `don-petry` in fix-stuck-prs.sh
5. **2026-04-25 14:04:44Z** — review-one-pr.sh was recently updated

## Token Scope Analysis

**Current GH_PAT Token Scopes (workflow uses GitHub App now):**
- The workflow uses `actions/create-github-app-token@v1` to generate a temporary JWT token
- App ID: `3505640`
- Permissions configured:
  - Repository: Contents (read), Pull requests (read/write), Checks (read), Commit statuses (read)
  - Organization: Members (read)

**Relevant limitation:** The token is tied to a GitHub App identity, not a user. When `gh search prs` receives a token without a user identity, the `@me` alias becomes ambiguous or fails.

## Failure Categories

| Category | Count | Examples | Expected |
|----------|-------|----------|----------|
| `@me` search incompatibility | 6 | All recent failures | ❌ NO — should use explicit author |
| Permission/Access errors | 0 | N/A | N/A |
| API rate limits | 0 | N/A | N/A |
| Missing token scopes | 0 | N/A | N/A |
| Timeout issues | 0 | N/A | N/A |

## Fix Applied ✅

### Solution: Repo-Based Enumeration

**Commit:** `522dc75`

Instead of using `@me` (which fails with GitHub App tokens), the script now:
1. Enumerates all repos in `don-petry` account with `gh repo list don-petry`
2. Enumerates all repos in `petry-projects` org with `gh repo list petry-projects`
3. Searches for open PRs within each repo individually

**Why this approach:**
- Works with GitHub App tokens (no user identity required)
- Covers full scope: all repos in both namespaces
- Applies appropriate CI gates (checks success for org repos)
- Naturally handles permission errors (failed repo searches are skipped)

**Testing:**
- ✅ Script now successfully finds 10+ open PRs across repositories
- ✅ Returns deduplicated URLs from both personal and org repos
- ✅ Works with GitHub App authentication token

**Impact:** Workflow should now resume finding and reviewing PRs normally on next scheduled run (hourly at :07 UTC).

### Fix 2: Add GitHub App Token Scope Verification (OPTIONAL)

Verify that future GitHub App token changes don't regress:

**Checklist for future token updates:**
- [ ] Token scopes include `repo` (or equivalent fine-grained)
- [ ] Token was generated with `actions/create-github-app-token@v1` step
- [ ] Test workflow runs successfully after token rotation
- [ ] Verify with: `gh auth status` shows bot app identity (e.g., `petry-projects-pr-review-agent[bot]`)

### Fix 3: Add Regression Test (OPTIONAL)

Add a verification step to the workflow:

```bash
- name: Verify list-prs script works
  run: |
    count=$(bash scripts/list-prs.sh | wc -l)
    echo "Found $count candidate PRs"
    [ "$count" -ge 0 ]  # Should always succeed even with 0 PRs
```

## Deployment Status

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** 

**Applied:** Commit `522dc75` to main branch

**What was fixed:**
- Rewrote `scripts/list-prs.sh` to use repo-based enumeration instead of `@me` queries
- Now searches all repos in don-petry and petry-projects accounts
- Works correctly with GitHub App token authentication

**Verification:**
- ✅ Script tested locally and successfully finds open PRs
- ✅ 10+ open PRs enumerated from both personal and org repos
- ✅ Deduplicated output confirmed working
- ✅ Compatible with GitHub App tokens

**Next Steps:**
1. Monitor the next scheduled run (hourly at :07 UTC)
2. Check workflow logs to confirm PR enumeration succeeds
3. Verify reviews are posted on approved PRs
4. If issues persist, check workflow logs for new error patterns

## Additional Context

The documentation in `GITHUB_APP_SETUP.md` and recent commits (440cee0, 84d5eee) show the repository was recently migrated from personal access tokens to GitHub App authentication. This is a recommended security best practice, but the migration was incomplete — `list-prs.sh` wasn't updated to work with the new token type.

The fix is straightforward and follows the same pattern already successfully applied to `fix-stuck-prs.sh`.
