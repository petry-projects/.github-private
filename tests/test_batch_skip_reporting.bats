# Regression tests for accurate exit-100 skip reporting in scripts/review-batch.sh
# (issue #898).
#
# The reviewer (review-one-pr.sh) returns exit 100 for *every* no-op/skip: an
# already-reviewed head, a CI-pending deferral, a CI-failing deferral, a
# human-changes-requested skip, an escalation skip, etc. The batch driver used
# to collapse all of these into a single "No-op (already reviewed)" line. That
# message is actively misleading for a CI-pending deferral — it claims a review
# already happened at the current head when in fact the PR is *owed* a review
# once CI goes green. That mislabelling is what made the #892 "deadlock" look
# like a stuck idempotency marker.
#
# These tests assert the batch reports the *reason* behind an exit-100 skip:
#   - a ci-pending skip must NOT claim "already reviewed" and must surface as a
#     deferral ("Deferred" / "CI still pending"),
#   - an already-reviewed-at-head skip must still say "already reviewed",
#   - a batch with at least one CI deferral must note "deferred" in the summary
#     so an operator scanning the run knows a review is still owed.
