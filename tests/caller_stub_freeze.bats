# Tests for scripts/caller_stub_freeze.sh — the ring-0 / self-host caller-stub
# freeze guard (#1255, epic #1052 Part B). It backstops the #1253
# validate-caller-inputs check for the specific self-host caller stubs
# (dev-lead.yml, pr-review-trigger.yml, ci-failure-analyst.lock.yml) whose
# reusable lives in this repo and is pinned to a canary channel tag.
#
# The guard reuses fleet_stub_drift.sh's byte-identity (blob-SHA equality)
# ALIGNED/DRIFTED/MISSING model: each stub's trigger (`on:`) + `uses:`/`with:`
# forwarding block must stay byte-identical to a committed baseline under
# tests/fixtures/caller-stub-freeze/*.block. Any edit flips it DRIFTED and fails
# CI unless the baseline is intentionally regenerated (a reviewed channel change).
#
# Most assertions are PURE (synthetic SHAs / in-repo files, no network). Run:
#   bats tests/caller_stub_freeze.bats
#
# Drift TSV format (4 fields, tab-separated), shared with fleet_stub_drift.sh:
#   1:file  2:status  3:current_sha  4:baseline_sha
