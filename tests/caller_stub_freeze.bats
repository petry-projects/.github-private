# Tests for scripts/caller_stub_freeze.sh — the ring-0 / self-host caller-stub
# freeze guard (#1255, epic #1052 Part B; taught the ingress form in #1725).
#
# It backstops the #1253 validate-caller-inputs check for the self-host caller
# stubs whose reusable lives in this repo and is pinned to a canary channel tag.
# The guard reuses fleet_stub_drift.sh's byte-identity ALIGNED/DRIFTED/MISSING
# model: each frozen block must stay byte-identical to a committed baseline under
# tests/fixtures/caller-stub-freeze/*.block.
#
# #1725 makes the extractor JOB-SCOPED so the guard survives the collapse of the
# per-role stubs into a single multi-job agent-ingress.yml: extract_forwarding_block
# now takes a JOB NAME and captures the shared `on:` block plus THAT job's
# `uses:`/`with:`/`permissions:` sub-blocks (`if:`/`secrets:`/`name:` excluded).
#
# QA test-risk #8: a single parameterised (form, file, job) table drives BOTH the
# legacy per-role stub and the collapsed ingress form, so a new case is answered
# for both or fails to run. Backward-compat (AC #4) is proven by FAILURE, not just
# passing (QA #6): a drifted job flips DRIFTED and the annotation message + job
# name are asserted, so a silent no-op cannot pass.
#
# Run: bats tests/caller_stub_freeze.bats
#
# Drift TSV format is fleet_stub_drift.sh's 4 fields plus a 5th job column added
# here: 1:file  2:status  3:current_sha  4:baseline_sha  5:job
# status ∈ { ALIGNED, DRIFTED, MISSING }
