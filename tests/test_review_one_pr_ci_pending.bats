# Regression guard for the ci-pending -> ci-success transition (issue #898).
#
# Incident: on PR #892 (head SHA 8203876e5b0718dd3d672fed4eec8394e5d3729d) the
# reviewer logged a ci-pending skip while checks were still running, then never
# re-reviewed after CI went green — the PR sat un-approved until a manual
# force_review. The reporter's hypothesis was that the ci-pending skip records
# an "already reviewed" idempotency marker that short-circuits the later
# (CI-green) trigger at the same SHA.
#
# This guard locks in the property that makes the pending -> success transition
# safe: the ci-pending skip is NON-TERMINAL. review-one-pr.sh must exit with the
# skip sentinel (100) carrying reason "ci-pending" WITHOUT writing any marker
# (no `gh pr comment` / `gh pr review`). Because no marker is written at the
# pending head SHA, the idempotency check cannot find one when CI later flips to
# success at that same SHA, so the re-trigger is review-eligible rather than a
# no-op. If a future change ever made the ci-pending path post a marker, this
# test fails and flags the reintroduced deadlock.
#
# Run with: bats tests/test_review_one_pr_ci_pending.bats
