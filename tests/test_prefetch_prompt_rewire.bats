# Structural guard for the tier-3 audit + single-review pre-fed-context rewire
# (epic #1101, Story 5 / #1105).
#
# Story 2 (#1103) persists the FULL diff + superset metadata ONCE to SHA-bound
# files exposed as PR_CONTEXT_DIFF_FILE / PR_CONTEXT_METADATA_FILE (gated
# DEFAULT-OFF behind PREFETCH_CONTEXT_ENABLED). This story rewires
# prompts/security-audit.md and prompts/single-review.md to CONSUME those files
# instead of re-running `gh pr view` / `gh pr diff` when they are present and
# fresh, while staying byte-identical when the flag is off (files absent), and
# keeping their dynamic `gh api` / MCP / LSP steps intact.
#
# These checks are deterministic and offline — the live single/audit smoke run
# (AC #5) needs the real cascade engine. They guard against the pre-fed section
# being silently removed or hollowed out by a future edit/template sync, the same
# silent-revert regression class the repo defends against elsewhere (#655, #823).
