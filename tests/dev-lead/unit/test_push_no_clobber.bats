# Unit tests for scripts/lib/git-push-guard.sh :: push_no_clobber (#1311).
#
# Defense-in-depth for the concurrent-writer race: after dev-lead's agent runs,
# the push must never discard a commit dev-lead did not fetch. A plain
# fast-forward push can only ever be REJECTED (never overwrites); a rewritten
# (rebased) branch is retried with --force-with-lease, which ABORTS if the
# remote advanced beyond the last-seen remote-tracking ref. A bare --force is
# never used.
