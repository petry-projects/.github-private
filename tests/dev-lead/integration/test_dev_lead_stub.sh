# Validates that dev-lead.yml is a thin caller stub, not an inline workflow.
#
# The org standard (standards/ci-standards.md#5-dev-lead-agent) requires
# dev-lead.yml to delegate all logic to dev-lead-reusable.yml via a `uses:`
# call. An inline copy drifts independently and cannot benefit from central
# fixes to the reusable.
#
# Regression guard: compliance audit check `non-stub-dev-lead.yml` (issue #395)
# was filed because dev-lead.yml had diverged into a full inline workflow.
