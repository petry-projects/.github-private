# Validates dev-lead's concurrency model: per-PR and per-issue lanes with
# cancel-in-progress:false, which serialize runs WITHIN a PR/issue (one active
# run at a time, the rest queued) while letting unrelated PRs/issues proceed in
# their own lanes.
#
# Same-PR serialization matters: two dev-lead runs editing one PR's branch in
# parallel would push over each other (and, with auto-merge on, race a merge).
# A per-PR group + cancel-in-progress:false is what guarantees one-at-a-time.
#
# Regression note: this previously asserted a single repo-wide 'dev-lead' group
# (#278). #450 replaced that with per-PR/per-issue lanes so issue pickups are no
# longer cancelled by unrelated PR traffic — this test was updated to match.
