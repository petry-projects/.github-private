# The dev-lead issue-pickup race: GitHub fires one issues:labeled event per label
# added in a single API call. If the reusable's per-issue concurrency used
# cancel-in-progress:true, a later (non-dev-lead) labeled event could CANCEL the
# run triggered by the dev-lead label before it dispatched — a "successful"
# workflow that opened no PR. The fix (#450) is separate per-issue/per-PR lanes
# with cancel-in-progress:FALSE, so same-lane events queue behind the active run
# and the pickup always finishes. These asserts fail loudly if anyone flips it back.
