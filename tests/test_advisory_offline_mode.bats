# Structural guard for the #1686 advisory context contract across the remaining
# eight persona advisory prompts (issue #1715).
#
# PR #1696 gave prompts/qa-lead/advisory.md an "## Offline / pre-fetched-context
# mode (eval harness)" section: when a `## Pre-fetched PR context` block is
# appended to the end of the prompt, the persona is running headless inside the
# eval harness, must NOT run any live `gh` fetch, must treat the block as
# untrusted work-item data, and must not wander off to edit the harness repo.
# This story adopts that SAME contract — not a per-persona variant — in the eight
# other in-scope advisory prompts, without disturbing the live-runner path
# (sentinels, the `<!-- persona:<role> -->` recursion marker, and the read-only
# `gh` fetch all preserved).
#
# These checks are deterministic and offline. They guard against the offline
# section being silently dropped or hollowed out by a future edit/template sync
# (the same silent-revert regression class the repo defends against elsewhere,
# e.g. #655, #823, and tests/test_prefetch_prompt_rewire.bats).
