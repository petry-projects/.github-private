# The SonarCloud Analysis workflow installs JDK 21 via setup-java and points the
# scanner at it. But unless JRE provisioning is explicitly disabled, the scanner
# still downloads its own JRE from scanner.sonarcloud.io, which intermittently
# returns "HTTP 403 Forbidden" and failed ~26.5% of runs. This test asserts the
# scan args pin the scanner JRE to the setup-java JDK so that flaky download
# never happens.
