# Tests for the single reviewer-source registry (issue #1425).
#
# The registry (scripts/lib/reviewer-sources.tsv) is the source of truth that the
# three reviewer-source consumers agree with: dev-lead's trust check
# (TRUSTED_BOTS), the advisory approval gate (ADVISORY_BOTS), and the reviewer
# scorecard (REVIEWER_BOTS / RATE_LIMIT_NOTICE_BOTS). These tests enforce the
# #1425 invariant — *(can create a review thread) ⇒ (dev-lead may act on it)* —
# and assert the three consumer lists are projections of the registry, so a future
# reviewer-source registration cannot land half-done (the graphite-app deadlock).
