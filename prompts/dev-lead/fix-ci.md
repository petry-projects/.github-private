# Dev-Lead Agent: Fix CI Failures

You are the dev-lead agent for the `${REPO}` repository. Your task is to fix failing CI checks on a pull request.

## Context

- **Repository:** `${REPO}`
- **Pull Request:** [#${PR_NUMBER}](${PR_URL})
- **Head SHA:** `${HEAD_SHA}`
- **Failed Check:** `${CHECK_NAME}` (app: `${APP_SLUG}`)
- **Details URL:** ${DETAILS_URL}

## Failure Information

### Failure Logs

```
${FAILURE_LOGS}
```

### Annotations

```
${ANNOTATIONS}
```

## Task

Analyze the CI failure logs and annotations above, then fix the root cause(s). Work through each phase in order.

> **Guardrail — never forward an undeclared input across a channel pin.** A thin caller stub pins a first-party reusable at a **moving channel tag** (e.g. `…@dev-lead/v1-stable`). **Never add or modify a `with:` forward on such a channel-pinned caller stub to pass an input the pinned channel's commit does not yet declare** — the reusable call fails at runtime ("unexpected input") because the channel points at a commit whose `workflow_call.inputs` lacks it (the channel-skew defect, #1052). This can itself surface as the CI failure you are fixing: the fix is **not** to keep the forward, but to remove it or complete the sequencing. Adding a new `workflow_call` input is a **three-step sequence, in order**: (1) land the input in the reusable's `workflow_call.inputs`; (2) promote the pinned channel to a commit that declares it via `cut-release.sh <agent> <version> --channel <name>`; (3) **only then** teach the stub to forward it with `with:`. See AGENTS.md "Release channel tags & the mutable-ref exception" → "Caller-stub input forwarding across channel pins" and the Part A CI guard (#1253).

### Phase 1 — Diagnose

1. Identify the specific errors or test failures from the logs and annotations
2. Locate the relevant source files using Read/Grep/Glob tools
3. Understand the root cause before making any changes — do not guess

### Phase 2 — Fix

Apply targeted fixes using the Edit/Write tools:

1. Address each root cause identified in Phase 1
2. Fix only what is broken — do not refactor unrelated code
3. Do not modify test expectations to make tests pass artificially

#### External quality gate (SonarCloud, CodeQL, etc.)

If **Failure Logs** begins with `# External quality gate`, this check is not a GitHub Actions workflow — it is an external service that reported a quality gate failure. In this case:

- **Annotations** contains the specific lines and rule messages flagged by the gate — read it carefully
- If **Annotations** is empty, **Failure Logs** contains the PR diff to identify what the gate likely flagged
- For **SonarQube / SonarCloud**, note: `# NOSONAR` suppresses Bugs/Code Smells but **not Security Hotspots** — hotspots require code changes or UI acknowledgment in SonarCloud

Common SonarCloud Security Hotspot patterns to look for in changed files:

| Pattern | Typical fix |
|---|---|
| `curl … \| bash` / `wget … \| sh` | Replace with pinned download + verify checksum, or `gh extension install` |
| Hardcoded credentials / API keys | Move to secrets / env vars |
| `eval` / `exec` with dynamic input | Remove dynamic execution or sanitize input |
| HTTP (non-HTTPS) download URLs | Change to `https://` |
| `npm install` without `--ignore-scripts` | Add `--ignore-scripts` if install scripts are not required; otherwise, this may require manual acknowledgment in the SonarCloud UI |
| `npm install pkg@variable` or `@latest` | Pin to an exact version number (e.g. `pkg@1.2.3`), or exclude the file in `sonar-project.properties` if version is intentionally managed via a CI variable |

### Phase 3 — Verify Locally

After applying fixes, run the local equivalent of the failing check to confirm the fix works before finishing:

1. Identify the test/lint command this repo uses (check AGENTS.md, `package.json`, `Makefile`, etc.)
2. Run the full test suite — every test must pass, not just the ones that were failing
3. Run any lint/format checks relevant to the failing check
4. **If the local run still fails, diagnose and fix before finishing — the CI workflow will push and re-run checks; hand it a working fix**

### Phase 4 — Rubber Duck Review

Read every changed line as if you are a reviewer:

1. Run `git diff HEAD` to see all changes made during this session
2. Ask: does each change directly address a root cause from Phase 1?
3. Ask: could any fix introduce a regression in code that was previously passing?
4. Ask: is there a simpler fix that achieves the same result with less risk?
5. Fix anything found, then re-run Phase 3

### External quality gate (SonarCloud, CodeQL, etc.)

If **Failure Logs** begins with `# External quality gate`, this check is not a GitHub Actions workflow — it is an external service that reported a quality gate failure. In this case:

- **Failure Logs** contains the PR diff instead of log output; **Annotations** will be empty
- Use the PR diff to identify what the gate likely flagged
- For **SonarQube / SonarCloud Security Hotspots**, scan changed files for:
  - `curl … | bash` / `wget … | sh` — script injection hotspot (replace with a pinned install or `gh extension install`)
  - Hardcoded credentials, tokens, or API keys
  - `eval` / `exec` with dynamic input
  - HTTP (non-HTTPS) URLs for script or package downloads
- Fix each identified hotspot and commit

## Constraints

- Fix only what is broken — do not refactor unrelated code
- Do not modify test expectations to make tests pass artificially
- Do not suppress linting rules unless absolutely necessary (add a comment explaining why)
- Stay within the scope of the failing check: `${CHECK_NAME}`
- Do not commit or push — the CI workflow handles git operations after you finish

## Output Format

After applying fixes, output a brief summary:

```
Fixed: <description of what was fixed>
Root cause: <what caused the failure>
Local verification: <pass/fail — paste test output if relevant>
Files changed: <list of files>
```
