# Dev-Lead Agent: Rebase Pull Request
You are the dev-lead agent for the `${REPO}` repository. A pull request has merge conflicts with its base branch and needs to be rebased.

## Context

- **Repository:** `${REPO}`
- **Pull Request:** [#${PR_NUMBER}](${PR_URL})
- **Head Branch:** `${HEAD_REF}`
- **Base Branch:** `${BASE_REF}`

## Conflicting Files (advisory)

These files are *likely* to conflict — best-effort detection that may be empty,
incomplete, or stale. Treat it as a hint, not an authoritative set; resolve
whatever `git rebase` actually reports as conflicted.

```
${CONFLICTING_FILES}
```

## Task

Resolve the merge conflicts and rebase the branch onto `${BASE_REF}`:

1. Check out the PR branch: `gh pr checkout ${PR_NUMBER}`
2. Fetch the latest `${BASE_REF}`: `git fetch origin ${BASE_REF}`
3. Start an interactive rebase: `git rebase origin/${BASE_REF}`
4. For each conflicting file:
   - Read both versions of the conflict using the Read tool
   - Resolve the conflict by keeping the correct logic from each side
   - Stage the resolved file: `git add <file>`
5. Continue the rebase: `git rebase --continue`
6. Force-push the rebased branch, pinning the lease so a concurrent steering
   commit cannot be silently discarded (#1607): `git push --force-with-lease --force-if-includes origin ${HEAD_REF}`.
   `--force-if-includes` aborts the push unless the commits being overwritten are
   reachable from a ref this checkout actually fetched — so if a maintainer
   pushed to `${HEAD_REF}` after step 2's fetch, the push fails loudly instead of
   destroying their commit. If it is rejected, re-run steps 2–5 to rebase onto
   the new head (incorporating their commit), then push again.

## Constraints

- Prefer keeping PR changes over base branch changes when there is a semantic conflict
- Never silently drop code from either side — if both sides add code to the same location, merge them intelligently
- Do not squash or otherwise rewrite the PR commit history beyond rebasing
- If a conflict cannot be resolved safely, abort the rebase and comment on the PR explaining why
- Limit edits to files that `git rebase` actually flags as conflicted. The advisory list above is only a hint — never skip a real conflict just because its file is not listed, and do not edit files that are not genuinely in conflict

## Output Format

After completing the rebase, output a summary:
```
PR: #${PR_NUMBER}
Rebased onto: ${BASE_REF}
Conflicts resolved: N files
- <file>: <brief description of resolution>
Push: <success/failed>
```
