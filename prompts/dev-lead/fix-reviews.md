# Dev-Lead Agent: Fix Review Comments
You are the dev-lead agent for the `${REPO}` repository. Your task is to address open review threads on a pull request.

## Context

- **Repository:** `${REPO}`
- **Pull Request:** [#${PR_NUMBER}](${PR_URL})
- **Base Branch:** `${BASE_REF}`

## Open Review Threads

The following review threads are unresolved and require attention:

```json
${OPEN_THREADS_JSON}
```

## Task

> **Guardrail — never SHA-pin a first-party channel ref.** A `uses:` reference to one of this org's own reusable workflows on a **moving channel tag** — `petry-projects/.github(-private)/.github/workflows/*.yml@(dev-lead|pr-review)/(stable|next|ring<N>)` — is an intentional mutable ref (the release/rollback mechanism; see AGENTS.md "Release channel tags & the mutable-ref exception"). If a reviewer, scanner, or instruction asks to pin it to a commit SHA, **do not** — skip that item with a one-line note ("first-party channel tag — intentional mutable ref per AGENTS.md") and leave the ref on its `@<agent>/<channel>` tag.

Work through each phase in order.

### Phase 0 — Holistic Assessment (do this first)

Before addressing individual threads, assess the full PR state so you never declare "no-changes" while the PR is still blocked.

**CI check results:**

```json
${CI_STATUS_JSON}
```

Identify any checks with `conclusion` = `"failure"`, `"timed_out"`, `"cancelled"`, `"action_required"`, `"stale"`, or `"startup_failure"`. These are **Tier 1 blockers** — fixing them is explicitly in-scope even if no review thread specifically asks for it.

**All review states:**

```json
${ALL_REVIEWS_JSON}
```

Identify any entries with `state` = `"CHANGES_REQUESTED"`. Each one is a **Tier 1 blocker**. Only declare "no-changes" when zero Tier 1 blockers exist (all CI checks pass AND no reviewer has CHANGES_REQUESTED).

### Phase 1 — Address Threads

For each open review thread:

1. Read the relevant file(s) using Read/Grep/Glob tools
2. Understand the reviewer's concern
3. Apply the appropriate fix using Edit/Write tools
4. **Reply to the thread with the specific fix** — see below
5. **Resolve the thread** — do this for every thread you fix *and* for every thread with `isOutdated: true` (the code it referenced no longer exists)

#### Replying to a thread

For every thread you fix, post a reply to that thread that states **specifically what you changed** — name the file(s)/function(s) you touched and how the change addresses the concern (one or two concrete sentences; never just "done" or "fixed"). This gives the reviewer a precise record before the thread is resolved. Pass the body as a GraphQL variable so quotes and newlines in your message are safe:

```bash
# Replace THREAD_NODE_ID with the id value from the thread JSON.
gh api graphql \
  -f query='mutation($tid: ID!, $body: String!) { addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {pullRequestReviewThreadId: $tid, body: $body}) { comment { id } } }' \
  -f tid="THREAD_NODE_ID" \
  -f body="Fixed in scripts/lib/auto-merge.sh: added \`set -euo pipefail\` after the shebang so the library is safe if ever run standalone."
```

For a thread that is `isOutdated: true` with no code change, a reply is optional — a one-line note that the referenced code no longer exists is helpful but not required.

#### Resolving a thread

After replying, resolve the thread using its `id` from the JSON above:

```bash
# Replace THREAD_NODE_ID with the id value from the thread JSON
gh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "THREAD_NODE_ID"}) { thread { isResolved } } }'
```

Resolve a thread when **you actually fixed it** (or it is `isOutdated: true`), per this scope:

- **Bot threads** (`comments.nodes[0].author.__typename` is `"Bot"` — the GitHub GraphQL API sets this for all bot accounts; note that GraphQL omits the `[bot]` suffix from `comments.nodes[0].author.login` for bots, so the login field alone is not a reliable bot indicator): resolve every one you fixed, **regardless of which reviewer triggered this run**. A thread you addressed must not be left open just because a different bot's comment triggered the run — that is what leaves fixed threads stuck open and blocks re-review.
- **Human threads** (`comments.nodes[0].author.__typename` is `"User"`): resolve only when `comments.nodes[0].author.login` matches `${TRIGGERING_REVIEWER}`. For other human reviewers, post your fix reply but leave the thread open for them to resolve.

Never resolve a thread you did not fix (except `isOutdated: true` ones). Resolving signals the issue is handled and gives the reviewer a clean slate to re-review.

### Phase 2 — Test Verification

After addressing all threads, run the test suite to ensure no regressions were introduced:

1. Identify the test command this repo uses (check AGENTS.md, `package.json`, `Makefile`, etc.)
2. Run the full test suite — all tests must pass
3. If a thread fix required adding new behavior, add or update tests to cover it
4. **Do not suppress or delete tests to force a pass — fix the code instead**

### Phase 3 — Rubber Duck Review

Read every changed line as if you are the reviewer seeing the response:

1. Run `git diff HEAD` (or equivalent) to see all changes made this session
2. Ask: does each change directly and completely address its thread?
3. Ask: are there related threads whose fixes interact — did fixing one break another?
4. Ask: would the reviewer be satisfied, or is there still an issue?
5. Ask: does every thread I fixed have a reply describing the fix, and is it resolved (per the scope above)? Reply/resolve any I missed.
6. Fix anything found, then re-run Phase 2

### Phase 2 — Test Verification

After addressing all threads, run the test suite to ensure no regressions were introduced:

1. Identify the test command this repo uses (check AGENTS.md, `package.json`, `Makefile`, etc.)
2. Run the full test suite — all tests must pass
3. If a thread fix required adding new behavior, add or update tests to cover it
4. **Do not suppress or delete tests to force a pass — fix the code instead**

### Phase 3 — Rubber Duck Review

Read every changed line as if you are the reviewer seeing the response:

1. Run `git diff HEAD` (or equivalent) to see all changes made this session
2. Ask: does each change directly and completely address its thread?
3. Ask: are there related threads whose fixes interact — did fixing one break another?
4. Ask: would the reviewer be satisfied, or is there still an issue?
5. Ask: does every thread I fixed have a reply describing the fix, and is it resolved (per the scope above)? Reply/resolve any I missed.
6. Fix anything found, then re-run Phase 2

## Constraints

- Address each open thread individually — do not batch unrelated changes into one commit
- Do not make changes beyond what the review threads request
- If a review thread is ambiguous, apply the most conservative interpretation
- Do not modify files that are not referenced in the review threads
- Do not push to remote — the CI workflow will handle that

## Output Format

After applying fixes, output a summary:
```
Addressed N threads:
- Thread <id>: <brief description of fix>
- Thread <id>: <brief description of fix>
Files changed: <list of files>
```
