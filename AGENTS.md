## Repository Context

This is the `.github-private` org infrastructure repo for `petry-projects`. It contains:

- **`agents/`** — Copilot custom agent profiles (org-wide, invocable from GitHub.com, VS Code, JetBrains)
- **`frameworks/`** — Agentic frameworks installed via `git subtree` (bmad-method, spec-kit, gsd)
- **`scripts/`** — Shell orchestration for GitHub Actions
- **`.github/workflows/`** — Scheduled automation (PR review, health checks)

## Project-Specific Standards

### Workflow Files

- Do **not** modify `.github/workflows/agent-shield.yml` — this is exempted from agent modification per
  [`standards/agent-standards.md`](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/agent-standards.md).
- `.github/workflows/dev-lead.yml` is a thin caller stub that delegates to
  `dev-lead-reusable.yml` (the canonical org standard). To change behavior for
  all org repos, edit `dev-lead-reusable.yml`. Repo-specific trigger adjustments
  may be made to `dev-lead.yml` per the stub's header comment. When adding a `with:`
  forward to this (or any) channel-pinned caller stub, follow the input-change
  sequencing in "Release channel tags & the mutable-ref exception" →
  ["Caller-stub input forwarding across channel pins"](#caller-stub-input-forwarding-across-channel-pins):
  never forward an input the pinned channel does not yet declare.
- All other workflow changes must use templates from
  [`standards/workflows/`](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/tree/main/standards/workflows) verbatim.
- **Note:** `.github/workflows/auto-rebase.yml` pins the reusable workflow at the `@auto-rebase/v2-next`
  moving channel tag — the major-scoped dogfood channel this repo rides ahead of the canonical
  `@auto-rebase/v2-stable` org stub in `standards/workflows/auto-rebase.yml`. Do not
  repoint it to a frozen `@vX` tag, `@main`, or a SHA — `tests/dev-lead/integration/test_auto_rebase_stub.py`
  (#139) enforces this. The repo-specific `auto-rebase-retry.yml` and `auto-rebase-health.yml` workflows
  depend on the sentinel-trigger behavior provided by the current channel; downgrading to a pre-sentinel
  frozen tag is a behavioral regression. As a channel-pinned caller stub it is also subject to
  ["Caller-stub input forwarding across channel pins"](#caller-stub-input-forwarding-across-channel-pins):
  do not add a `with:` forward for an input the pinned channel does not yet declare.
- **Exception:** The `gh-aw-compile` job in `lint.yml` is a documented repo-specific addition that gates
  agentic workflow compilation. It is not covered by the org template and must not be removed by template
  syncs. If the org template gains a `gh-aw-compile` equivalent, remove this exception and defer to the
  template instead.
- **Exception:** `token-report.yml` (weekly Token Cost Observatory report) is a documented repo-specific
  workflow with no corresponding org template in `standards/workflows/`. It must not be removed by template
  syncs. If the org template gains a token-report equivalent, remove this exception and defer to the
  template instead.
- **Exception:** `test-deletion-guard.yml` (#823) is a documented repo-specific workflow with no org template.
  It is one half of the #655 **stale-base / semantic-revert** guard: it fails a PR that deletes any file under
  `tests/` unless a maintainer adds the `ack-test-deletion` label, so a silent test removal becomes a deliberate,
  reviewable decision. The other half is the **"require branches up to date before merging"** ruleset on `main`
  (already enabled). Together they close the gap behind #655, where a PR merged from a stale base reverted a
  shipped fix and deleted its regression test in the same green-CI diff. Do not remove either guard.
  Because this is a **gate** workflow whose `failure` conclusion is intentional enforcement (it blocks a
  bad PR), it is exempt from the Fleet Monitor's high-failure issue tracking via `FLEET_GATE_WORKFLOWS`
  in `scripts/fleet_report.sh` (#941) — otherwise a guard doing its job produces false-positive trackers.
  `holdout-guard.yml` is exempt for the same reason. Add new gate workflows of this class to that list.
- **Exception:** `pr-review-sweep.yml` (stuck-review sweep, #573/#898) is a documented repo-specific
  workflow with no corresponding org template in `standards/workflows/`. It re-dispatches reviews for PRs
  that went green after a ci-pending/ci-failing skip, via two triggers: a scheduled cron (the guaranteed
  ≤15-min backstop) and a `workflow_run: completed` fast path (#898) that scopes the sweep to the
  completing CI run's PR(s) for near-instant re-review. It must not be removed by template syncs. If the org
  template gains an equivalent re-trigger sweep, remove this exception and defer to the template instead.
- **Exception:** `readme-refresh.yml` (weekly org README refresh) is a documented repo-specific workflow
  with no corresponding org template in `standards/workflows/`. It regenerates the four org "meta-repo"
  READMEs (public + member-only org profiles, and the `.github` / `.github-private` repo landing pages)
  from live org state via `scripts/aw-readme-refresh.sh` + `prompts/aw/readme-refresh.md`, then opens or
  updates one rolling PR (`chore/readme-refresh`, label `readme-refresh`) per repo for human review. It
  never direct-pushes. It must not be removed by template syncs. If the org template gains an equivalent,
  remove this exception and defer to the template instead.
- **Exception:** The `bats` test list in `lint.yml` is extended with repo-specific test files (e.g.
  `tests/test_push_protection.bats`) beyond the org template baseline. When adding new test files to this
  repo, add them to this list. Template syncs must not reset it to the base template list. This includes
  `tests/test_downstream_impact_regression.bats` (#753, epic #748) — the golden-fixture regression guard
  that pins the pure downstream-impact mapper (`scripts/lib/downstream-impact.sh`) against a frozen manifest
  and expected outputs under `tests/fixtures/downstream-impact/golden/`. The golden manifest is intentionally
  independent of the live `scripts/lib/consumer-manifest.json` so a legitimate manifest refresh does not break
  the guard — only a change to the mapper's output does, which then requires an explicit fixture update visible
  in the diff. It runs in the always-run `bats` job (no `paths:` filter) so it stays a stable check.
- **Exception:** `holdout-guard.yml` (#692, epic #581) is a documented repo-specific workflow with no
  corresponding org template in `standards/workflows/`. It is the hard CI enforcement behind the advisory
  `.github/CODEOWNERS` rule over `evals/`: it fails any PR authored by the automated skill-proposer identity
  that changes a held-out path, keyed on PR author + changed paths. It runs on every PR (no `paths:` filter)
  so it stays a stable required status check. The author/path decision lives in
  `scripts/lib/holdout-guard.sh` (tests: `tests/test_holdout_guard.bats`). It must not be removed by template
  syncs. If the org template gains a held-out immutability equivalent, remove this exception and defer to the
  template instead.
- **Exception:** `auto-rebase-retry.yml` is a documented repo-specific workflow with no corresponding org
  template in `standards/workflows/`. It is a `workflow_run` handler that self-heals a *failed* Auto-rebase
  run by re-running its failed jobs (bounded by `run_attempt`) — the gap left by the conflict-only sentinel
  path, which the thin-caller `auto-rebase.yml` and central reusable cannot cover. It must not be removed by
  template syncs. If the org template gains a retry equivalent, remove this exception and defer to the
  template instead.
- **Exception:** `auto-rebase-health.yml` (#737, epic #736) is a documented repo-specific workflow with no
  corresponding org template in `standards/workflows/`. It is a daily (≤1/day) + `workflow_dispatch` report
  that quantifies the agentic-conflict-resolution rate (conflict-sentinel fires vs. dev-lead `rebase`
  responses, both HTML-comment markers GitHub search cannot index) and estimates auto-rebase fan-out CI
  volume from `auto-rebase.yml` run telemetry. It is a no-LLM gh-API + jq report (logic in
  `scripts/auto_rebase_health.sh`, tests in `tests/auto_rebase_health.bats`) and runs on `github.token`
  only — no cross-org PAT. It must not be removed by template syncs. If the org template gains an
  auto-rebase instrumentation equivalent, remove this exception and defer to the template instead.
- **Exception:** `initiative-planner-canary.yml` (#822, closes #655 item 3) is a documented repo-specific
  workflow with no corresponding org template in `standards/workflows/`. It is a daily (≤1/day) +
  `workflow_dispatch` post-merge canary that fires a **dry-run** dispatch of `initiative-planner.yml`
  against a fixture Ideas Discussion and alerts if the run fails or surfaces the `Unsupported event type:
  discussion` regression fingerprint — the silent-revert class of failure from #655 on the live
  `idea:approved` trigger. Logic lives in `scripts/initiative_canary.sh` (tests:
  `tests/test_initiative_canary.bats`); the fixture Discussion is configured via the repo variable
  `INITIATIVE_CANARY_DISCUSSION`. It must not be removed by template syncs. If the org template gains a
  live-trigger canary equivalent, remove this exception and defer to the template instead.
- **Exception:** `premature-closure-audit.yml` (#1077) is a documented repo-specific workflow with no
  corresponding org template in `standards/workflows/`. It is a weekly (≤1/week) + `workflow_dispatch`
  backstop for the dev-lead premature-closure defect: dev-lead closed tracking issues as `completed`
  without the fix landing on `main` (no merged closing PR). It flags issues closed as `completed` within
  `PC_MAX_OPEN_MINUTES` of opening with **no merged closing PR** and, in live mode, re-opens them +
  applies `dev-lead:needs-human` so an attempted-but-unresolved issue stays visibly open. It is a no-LLM
  gh-API + jq audit (pure logic in `scripts/lib/premature-closure-detect.sh`, tests in
  `tests/test_premature_closure_detect.bats`; wrapper in `scripts/premature-closure-audit.sh`). It is
  **staged**: read-only permissions with a `LIVE_MODE` repo-variable gate (mirrors `stale-manager.yml`) —
  writes require setting `LIVE_MODE=true` and adding `issues: write`. It must not be removed by template
  syncs. If the org template gains a closure-audit equivalent, remove this exception and defer to the
  template instead.
- **Exception:** `initiative-driver-canary.yml` (#885, epic #882) is a documented repo-specific workflow
  with no corresponding org template in `standards/workflows/`. It is a daily (≤1/day) +
  `workflow_dispatch` post-merge canary that fires a **dry-run** dispatch of `initiative-driver.yml`
  against a fixture target repo + epic and alerts if the run fails OR — for a configured fixture — if the
  run surfaces no `READY (dry-run, not labeling)` decision (a HOLLOW GREEN: the cross-repo
  gate/`blocked_by` resolved to nothing, so the release path is silently broken even though CI is green).
  Logic lives in `scripts/initiative_driver_canary.sh` (tests:
  `tests/test_initiative_driver_canary.bats`); the fixture is configured via the repo variables
  `INITIATIVE_DRIVER_CANARY_TARGET` / `INITIATIVE_DRIVER_CANARY_EPIC` (the fixture epic must carry
  `initiative:auto` with ≥1 ready open sub-issue). It must not be removed by template syncs. If the org
  template gains a cross-repo release-path canary equivalent, remove this exception and defer to the
  template instead.
- **Exception:** `pr-review-canary.yml` (#1256, epic #1052 Part D) is a documented repo-specific workflow
  with no corresponding org template in `standards/workflows/`. It is a post-merge (`push` to `main` on the
  pr-review stub/reusable paths) + daily off-peak cron + `workflow_dispatch` canary that fires a **dry-run**
  dispatch of `pr-review-trigger.yml` (the ring-0 self-host caller stub) and **fails loud if the run ends in
  `startup_failure`** — the exact conclusion of the #1034 channel-skew defect (a `with:` forward the pinned
  `pr-review/next` channel does not declare), which nothing in PR CI exercises. It complements the
  `validate-caller-inputs` (#1253) and `caller-stub-freeze` (#1255) static guards with a live post-merge
  signal. Logic lives in `scripts/pr_review_canary.sh` (tests: `tests/pr_review_canary.bats`); the dispatch
  requires `GH_PAT_WORKFLOWS` (a `workflow_dispatch` fired with `GITHUB_TOKEN` never starts a run). It must
  not be removed by template syncs. If the org template gains a self-host caller-stub canary equivalent,
  remove this exception and defer to the template instead.

- **Exception:** `dismiss-stale-bot-reviews.yml` (#617, blocker 3) is a documented repo-specific
  workflow with no corresponding org template in `standards/workflows/`. It fires on
  `pull_request: synchronize` and auto-dismisses allow-listed bot `CHANGES_REQUESTED` reviews
  that are attached to a superseded (non-head) commit — GitHub's built-in
  `dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push` only clears stale *approvals*, so bot CHANGES_REQUESTED
  reviews blocked merges after a re-review was already approved. The allow-list is a
  space-delimited `BOTS` env var in the workflow (currently `coderabbitai`); only same-repo PRs
  are processed (fork PRs receive a read-only token). It must not be removed by template syncs.
  If the org template gains an equivalent stale-bot-review dismissal, remove this exception and
  defer to the template instead.

### Template drift guard (`repo-template`)

`petry-projects/repo-template` is a **distribution artifact** of the canonical `standards/` in the public
`petry-projects/.github` repo: `scripts/seed-repo-template.sh` fetches each canonical workflow stub /
baseline file and ships it (caller stubs repinned to the published `@<name>/stable` channel, inline stubs +
baseline files verbatim). The `template-drift` job in `lint.yml` (#969, epic #964) guards that the files
**committed** in the template have not diverged from that standards-derived baseline — it re-derives the
expected content via `seed-repo-template.sh --emit-*`, compares its git blob SHA against the template repo's
committed blob SHA, and fails on any **DRIFTED** file, reusing the ALIGNED/DRIFTED/MISSING byte-identity
model from `scripts/fleet_stub_drift.sh` (pure logic + bats: `tests/template_stub_drift.bats`). It is a
PR-triggered check on the existing Lint workflow — **no new cron/scheduled workload**.

- **Allowlist exception — `ci.yml`:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the **one** shipped stub that
  intentionally carries real per-stack build/test steps and is customized per consumer (see the template's
  `BOOTSTRAP.md` "Customize `ci.yml` for your stack" step). A byte-identity guard would false-positive on the
  template's richer `ci.yml` default, so it is **excluded** from the drift check via the documented allowlist
  in `scripts/template_stub_drift.sh` (`TEMPLATE_DRIFT_ALLOWLIST`). Add a path to that allowlist **only** with
  a recorded rationale, the same way the exceptions above are documented.

- **Dependabot must not bump the shipped artifacts (#1435).** Dependabot runs in `repo-template` off the
  seeded `.github/dependabot.yml`. If that config enables the `github-actions` ecosystem, Dependabot bumps
  action versions **inside the shipped workflow stubs** — each bump rewrites a committed blob, so the file no
  longer matches the standards-derived baseline and `template-drift` fails **in this repo for a change made in
  another repo**. Because a non-required red check still halts pr-review here (`compute_ci_status` has no
  required/non-required notion — `scripts/lib/ci-status.sh`, `scripts/review-one-pr.sh`), a Dependabot bump in
  `repo-template` silently stops all PR review here with no signal on any PR. **Mechanism:**
  `scripts/seed-repo-template.sh` scopes the `github-actions` package-ecosystem **out** of the shipped
  `.github/dependabot.yml` (`_dependabot_scope_out_actions`; tests in `tests/test_seed_repo_template.bats`).
  The template's workflows are a distribution artifact of `standards/` and their action versions stay current
  by **re-seeding** (`bump standards/` → re-run `seed-repo-template.sh`), not by Dependabot — the same
  edit-standards-not-the-copy contract as the drift guard itself. This also correctly stops Dependabot from
  bumping the first-party channel-tag pins in the caller stubs, which are the sanctioned mutable-ref exception
  (see "Release channel tags & the mutable-ref exception"). Other ecosystems (npm/gomod/pip/…) pass through
  unchanged, and a consumer that wants Dependabot-managed action updates for its **own** (non-artifact)
  workflows adds the `github-actions` ecosystem back when it customizes its stack per `BOOTSTRAP.md`.
  - **Why not the alternatives.** *Option 2 — keep Dependabot, automate a re-seed after each bump* — was
    rejected: it leaves a permanent drift window between the bump and the re-seed during which
    `template-drift` is red and review here is halted. *Option 3 — point Dependabot at
    `petry-projects/.github` and let bumps flow to the template by re-seeding* — reaches the same
    end state but additionally requires a change in the public standards repo; the scope-out above is
    implementable entirely from this repo (which owns `seed-repo-template.sh`) and is a prerequisite for
    Option 3 anyway (the template still must not run its own `github-actions` Dependabot). If the standards
    repo later grows its own `github-actions` Dependabot + re-seed automation, this scope-out remains the
    correct template-side behavior.

### Reusable caller-input contract (`validate-caller-inputs`)

The `validate-caller-inputs` job in `lint.yml` (#1253, epic #1052; regression guard for #1034)
enforces that every reusable-workflow caller stub — `uses: <owner>/<repo>/.github/workflows/<wf>.yml@<ref>`
with a `with:` block — forwards only inputs that are **declared as `workflow_call` inputs at the
pinned `<ref>`**, and forwards every `required: true` input. `pull_request` CI runs the *base-branch*
stub, and GitHub validates a reusable's inputs only at startup against the **pinned** ref — so an
input-forwarding change to a channel-pinned caller stub is exercised by nothing in PR CI and only
breaks post-merge (the #1034 defect). This guard closes that gap.

- Logic lives in `scripts/validate-caller-inputs.sh` (pure parse/validate helpers + git resolution;
  tests: `tests/dev-lead/unit/test_validate_caller_inputs.bats`, fixtures under
  `tests/dev-lead/fixtures/caller-inputs/`, including a #1034 regression fixture).
- Same-repo channel tags (`dev-lead/*`, `pr-review/*`, `ci-failure-analyst/*`, …) are resolved by
  `git fetch`-ing the tag and reading the reusable at that ref. A ref that genuinely can't be resolved
  **soft-passes with a logged `::warning::` — never silently.** Cross-repo reusables (hosted in another
  repo, e.g. `petry-projects/.github`) are treated as unresolved here unless `VCI_RESOLVE_CROSS_REPO=1`
  opts in; the warning keeps the skip visible. Extending resolution to cross-repo channel tags is the
  scope of the later #1052 parts.
- PR-triggered on the existing Lint workflow — **no new cron/scheduled workload.** It must not be
  removed by template syncs. If the org template gains an equivalent, remove this exception and defer.

### Ring-0 caller-stub freeze (`caller-stub-freeze`)

The `caller-stub-freeze` job in `lint.yml` (#1255, epic #1052 Part B) is the byte-identity **backstop** to
`validate-caller-inputs` for the specific **ring-0 / self-host** caller stubs — the ones whose reusable lives
in **this** repo and is pinned to a canary channel tag (`docs/initiatives/agentic-release-strategy.md` §5):
`dev-lead.yml` (`@dev-lead/v1-next`), `pr-review-trigger.yml` (`@pr-review/next`), and
`ci-failure-analyst.lock.yml` (`@ci-failure-analyst/v1-stable`). A trigger/`with:` forwarding change to a
channel-pinned self-host stub is exercised by nothing in PR CI and only breaks post-merge (the #1034 defect
class), so each stub's `on:` trigger + `uses:`/`with:` forwarding block is frozen byte-for-byte against a
committed baseline (`tests/fixtures/caller-stub-freeze/*.block`).

- Any edit to a frozen block fails CI **unless** the baseline is intentionally regenerated in the same
  reviewed diff — an explicit, visible channel change rather than a silent post-merge break. Regenerate via
  `bash scripts/caller_stub_freeze.sh --update` and commit the changed `*.block` file(s).
- Logic lives in `scripts/caller_stub_freeze.sh`, reusing the ALIGNED/DRIFTED byte-identity model from
  `scripts/fleet_stub_drift.sh` (tests: `tests/caller_stub_freeze.bats`). To freeze another self-host caller
  stub, add a row to `CALLER_FREEZE_STUBS` and commit its baseline.
- PR-triggered on the existing Lint workflow — **no new cron/scheduled workload.** It must not be removed by
  template syncs. If the org template gains an equivalent, remove this exception and defer.

### Agentic interaction model

How agentic roles are triggered and how they interact is a **normative repo-local standard**,
[`docs/agentic-interaction-model.md`](./docs/agentic-interaction-model.md). It codifies the
event-first principle, the three trigger classes (event-driven / backstop-timer /
scheduled-origin), the `GITHUB_TOKEN` event-boundary rule and its two sanctioned bridges, the
timer contract, and the #860 runaway rules. Read it before adding or changing an agentic
workflow's `on:` block, a `schedule.cron`, or a cross-workflow dispatch — a new role must add a
row to its §4 classification table and declare a machine-readable per-role interaction contract
(`interaction-contracts/<name>.yml` and/or `personas/<id>/interaction.yml`), both CI-verified.

- **Adding a role?** Follow the step-by-step runbook
  [`docs/adding-an-agentic-role.md`](./docs/adding-an-agentic-role.md); each step cites the
  governing section of the standard.
- This section is consistent with, not competing with, "Scheduled workflows" below (which
  governs *when* a timer may fire) and the "Ring-0 caller-stub freeze" above (which byte-freezes
  the self-host caller stubs the standard classifies as Class 1). Like the off-peak scheduling
  standard, it is **repo-local first**, shaped for promotion into an org-wide
  `standards/agent-standards.md` in
  [`petry-projects/.github`](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github).

### Scheduled workflows

- **Never schedule at minute 0.** A scheduled workflow must not use a `0 * * * *`
  cron (or any `schedule.cron` whose minute field is `0`). Minute-0 crons cluster
  every repo's automation onto the top of the hour, contending for shared
  GitHub-hosted runner capacity and producing correlated bursts that are harder to
  observe and debug.
- **Use a staggered off-peak minute.** Pick a non-zero, non-round minute (e.g.
  `'11 9 * * 1'`, `'34 8 * * 1'`, `'27 6 * * *'`) so runs are spread across the hour.
  There is no single canonical offset — stagger distinct workflows onto different
  minutes rather than sharing one.
- **Idempotent/self-healing sweeps may run more often (Option 2).** A sweep that is
  idempotent — extra ticks are harmless and a missed tick self-heals on the next run
  — may run at a higher frequency on odd offsets (e.g. `'2,17,32,47 * * * *'`).
  Because such a workflow converges regardless of exactly when it fires, precise
  timing does not matter and the higher cadence buys lower worst-case latency at
  negligible cost. This does not license minute-0: even high-frequency sweeps use
  non-zero offsets.
- **CI enforcement.** The `validate-workflow-schedules` job in `lint.yml`
  (backed by `scripts/validate-workflow-schedules.sh`, tests in
  `tests/test_validate_workflow_schedules.bats`) fails any PR that introduces a
  minute-0 `schedule.cron` in `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `.github/workflows/*.md`,
  or `docs/aw/*.md`. The `frameworks/` subtrees are upstream-owned knowledge docs,
  not our schedules, and are intentionally out of scope.
- **Promotion:** this is currently a repo-local standard. To make it org-wide,
  lift it into [`petry-projects/.github`](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/ci-standards.md)
  (`standards/ci-standards.md`) and have repos defer to it — see the org-wide
  rollout tracked under epic #722.

### Fleet stub-drift remediation loop

The Actions Fleet Monitor (`.github/workflows/actions-fleet-monitor.yml`) detects per-repo
thin-caller stub drift and writes `fleet_stub_drift.json` every run. Epic #1148 adds an **opt-in,
DRY_RUN-default remediation loop** that consumes that artifact on the *same cadence* — it proposes
(never direct-pushes) the canonical stub bytes back to a drifted consumer repo as one PR per repo.
The loop is deliberately hard to fire by accident; it is bounded by four controls:

- **DRY_RUN default (`scripts/fleet_stub_remediate.sh`).** `DRY_RUN` defaults to `true`. Every
  scheduled and `workflow_call` run logs the remediation *intent* and makes zero write API calls.
  Live remediation is only ever reached on an explicit `workflow_dispatch` with the `remediate=live`
  input — the human go decision. The gate is `scripts/fleet_remediate_gate.sh`
  (tests: `tests/fleet_remediate_gate.bats`): live requires `workflow_dispatch` + `remediate=live`
  **and** the cross-repo write credential (`GH_PAT_WORKFLOWS`) **and** a configured pilot repo;
  any missing precondition degrades to dry-run with a `::warning::` and never fails the monitor
  (mirroring `fleet_monitor.sh`'s token-degradation posture). The remediation step is also
  `continue-on-error: true`, so it is strictly non-blocking for the daily monitor.
- **Pilot gate (`REMEDIATE_PILOT_REPO` / `vars.FLEET_REMEDIATE_PILOT_REPO`).** Live remediation is
  fail-closed to an explicitly named pilot repo: with none set, the driver refuses to write and stays
  dry-run. Every DRIFTED repo outside the pilot scope is logged `would remediate (out of pilot scope)`
  and skipped without writes. This is the pilot-first blast-radius bound before widening fleet-wide.
- **Per-run cap (`REMEDIATE_MAX_REPOS` / `vars.FLEET_REMEDIATE_MAX_REPOS`, default `1`).** The maximum
  number of repos remediated live in a single run. Repos beyond the cap are logged as *deferred*
  (never silently truncated) and picked up on a later run.
- **Never-overwrite allowlist (`REMEDIATION_ALLOWLIST` in `scripts/fleet_stub_remediate.sh`).** Files a
  consumer repo has intentionally customized are never re-synced — an allowlisted `owner/repo` or
  `owner/repo|stub_file` never appears in the remediation plan. It is intentionally empty (every tracked
  fleet stub is a verbatim deployment and *is* remediable) until a first deliberate customization is
  recorded. Add an entry **only** with a recorded rationale, the same recorded-rationale rule the
  template `ci.yml` drift exception follows.

Each live remediation is verified byte-for-byte (pushed blob SHA == canonical blob SHA) before its PR
is opened, and the per-repo drift-closed verdicts are surfaced in the run log (and an optional summary
artifact). **The human go/no-go to enable live pilot remediation — and, later, to widen fleet-wide — is
recorded as a comment on the tracking issue/PR**, consistent with the repo's go/no-go pattern and the
initiative-planner inert-epic model: the loop stays inert (dry-run) until a human explicitly flips a
run to `remediate=live` for the configured pilot.

### Agent Profiles (`agents/*.md`)

- Every agent profile must have YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, and `tools`.
- Agent names must be kebab-case and match the filename.
- Profiles are org-wide — changes affect all `petry-projects` repos.

### Framework Subtrees (`frameworks/`)

- The `frameworks/` directories are managed via `git subtree`. Do not edit them directly unless
  applying local overrides that cannot be upstreamed.
- To update a framework, use `git subtree pull` against the upstream remote.

### Scripts (`scripts/`)

- Scripts must be POSIX-compatible shell (`#!/usr/bin/env bash` with `set -euo pipefail`).
- No hardcoded tokens or secrets — use `$GITHUB_TOKEN` from the environment.

### Agent identity & credential secrets

Every persona/agent declares the GitHub account it **acts as** — the login it
commits, pushes, reviews, or comments as — in its manifest under
`runtime.identity` (`personas/<id>/persona.yml`): an `account` and the `credential`
secret holding that account's PAT. The runtime resolves `BOT_USER` from
`account` via `scripts/lib/resolve-persona-identity.sh`; **never** derive a
write persona's identity from a shared `vars.BOT_USER` — that coupling let
dev-lead regress to committing as the review-only machine user `donpetry-bot`
([#1316](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github-private/issues/1316)).

- **dev-lead** acts as `don-petry` (the owner); **pr-review** acts as the
  review-only machine user `donpetry-bot`. They are deliberately different accounts.
- PAT secrets follow **`GH_PAT_<ACCOUNT>[_<QUALIFIER>]`** (login upper-snake-cased),
  e.g. `GH_PAT_DON_PETRY`. Pre-existing account-named secrets (`DON_PETRY_BOT_GH_PAT`)
  are grandfathered.
- `lint.yml`'s `verify-persona-identity` job enforces the manifest↔workflow
  wiring; `validate-personas.py` makes `runtime.identity` mandatory. See
  `standards/persona-standards.md` §5.1 and
  `docs/pr-review-agent/machine-user-setup.md`.

### Initiative Planner — blocking open-questions gate

`scripts/initiative-planner/apply-plan.sh` will **not** materialize an epic + sub-issue
DAG while the plan still has plan-blocking open questions (#682). If `open_questions`
contains any item shaped `{"question": "...", "blocking": true}`, the script creates
**zero** issues, posts the questions back to the source discussion with "not yet planned"
framing, and exits cleanly (DRY_RUN unchanged). Plain-string `open_questions` remain
advisory and do not gate. This is a hard, script-level gate (like the `initiative:auto`
invariant) and must not be worked around with direct `gh` calls. See
`scripts/initiative-planner/README.md`.

### Oversized PRs (> 300 changed files)

GitHub's unified-diff endpoint (`gh pr diff`) is hard-capped at 300 changed files and returns
HTTP 406 above that limit.

- **PR-size guideline:** PRs should stay under 300 changed files to receive a full automated review.
  PRs exceeding 300 files are reviewed with a truncated diff and should be split where practical.
  This guideline is advisory — no CI gate enforces it.
- **Agent behavior on 406:** When `gh pr diff` returns the 406 "diff exceeded the maximum number of
  files" error, the cascade falls back to the per-file REST API (`/pulls/{n}/files`), assembles a
  truncated diff up to the configured line limit, and continues the review with a note that the diff
  is partial. The agent **never** exits with a fatal error (code 1) on the 406 — it always produces
  an actionable review or comment.

### Review artifact contract & rubric registry

- The review automation binds "what is being reviewed" to "how it is reviewed" via an
  artifact contract `{artifact_type, content_ref, rubric, output_channel}` and a versioned
  rubric-registry manifest. See [`scripts/lib/README.md`](./scripts/lib/README.md) for the
  contract, the manifest format (`scripts/lib/review-registry.tsv`), and the sourced lookup
  helper (`scripts/lib/review-registry.sh`).
- The registry is an input-adapter layer **above** `engine.sh` — it selects the rubric and
  output channel for an `artifact_type` and must not change engine/model routing. Register a
  new artifact_type by adding a manifest row; do not fork the reviewer.

### Cost reporting

- **All surfaced USD amounts are rounded to 2 decimals (cents).** Render every
  dollar figure through a single formatter (`_fmt_usd` in `scripts/token_report.sh`,
  `printf "$%.2f"`) so reports, issue comments, and step summaries stay consistent.
  Sub-cent values round to `$0.00`; use Effective Tokens (ET, `_fmt_int`) as the
  fine-grained comparator when cent precision is too coarse.
- Prices are data, not code: keep per-model rates in `scripts/lib/model-pricing.tsv`
  (effective-dated) — never hardcode dollar rates in scripts.
- **Promotion:** this is currently a repo-local standard. To make it org-wide,
  lift it into [`petry-projects/.github`](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/AGENTS.md)
  (the org AGENTS.md / `standards/`) and have repos defer to it.

### Release channel tags & the mutable-ref exception

First-party reusables are versioned via tags — see
[`docs/release/versioning.md`](./docs/release/versioning.md). This began with the `pr-review` and
`dev-lead` agents and now covers every first-party reusable we own — the reusables in this repo
(`pr-review`, `dev-lead`, `ci-failure-analyst`) and the cross-repo reusables hosted in
`petry-projects/.github` (`feature-ideation` and the six #482 reusables). **One convention applies to
all of them.** Two kinds of tag exist per reusable:

- **Immutable releases** `<name>/vX.Y.Z` — never moved or deleted; the audit trail and rollback targets.
- **Moving channel tags** `<name>/v<MAJOR>-<tier>` (major-scoped, #1184; tiers `stable`, and where live
  `next`/`ring0`/`ring1`) — what callers pin to; advanced on promotion by **moving** the tag.

**Scoped exception to the SHA-pin standard.** The org standard requires SHA-pinning actions to avoid
mutable-ref supply-chain risk. That rule targets **third-party** actions. The channel tags above are
intentionally **mutable** and are an accepted, documented exception because they reference
**first-party** reusable workflows we own. The exception is bounded by:

- The `release-channel-tags` repository **ruleset** restricts `update` and `deletion` on the
  first-party channel-tag namespaces (e.g. `pr-review/**`, `dev-lead/**`, `ci-failure-analyst/**`),
  with bypass limited to **OrganizationAdmin** and the automation **Integration** app. Net effect: the
  reusables' workflows (running as `GITHUB_TOKEN`) **cannot** move or delete release tags; only an admin
  or the promotion automation can. Extending the ruleset's target list to a newly-versioned reusable is
  an admin step that may lag the tooling/docs — the sanctioned-exception guidance below applies to a
  first-party channel tag regardless of whether its namespace has been added to the ruleset yet.
- Immutable `vX.Y.Z` tags are the real rollback targets; `scripts/cut-release.sh` refuses to overwrite
  an existing release tag.
- Channel-tag moves happen only via the (forthcoming) health-gated promotion workflow (#501); the
  ruleset bypass will be tightened to that workflow's identity when it lands.

Compliance audits must therefore **not** flag any first-party reusable channel tag (e.g.
`@pr-review/v1-stable`, `@dev-lead/v1-stable`, `@ci-failure-analyst/v0-stable`, or other `<name>/v<M>-<tier>`
channel tags) on first-party callers as "unpinned actions" — they are the sanctioned version-selection
mechanism (see the initiative analysis §5.1: `docs/initiatives/agentic-release-strategy.md`).

**feature-ideation (cross-repo).** The `feature-ideation` agent is released through the same model with
the channel set `{next, ring0, ring1, stable}`, so its `feature-ideation/v<MAJOR>-<tier>` pins (e.g., `feature-ideation/v1-stable`) are the **same
sanctioned mutable-ref exception** and must not be flagged as unpinned. Unlike `pr-review`/`dev-lead`
whose reusables live in this repo, `feature-ideation`'s reusable lives in **`petry-projects/.github`**
(this repo holds only the thin caller stub), so its release/channel tags are cut against that public
repo — and the protective ruleset bounding `feature-ideation/**` channel tags is therefore created
**there**, not on this repo (an untracked prerequisite in the public repo). See
[`docs/release/versioning.md`](./docs/release/versioning.md) "Cross-repo reusables".

#### Caller-stub input forwarding across channel pins

A thin caller stub pins its first-party reusable at a **moving channel tag** (e.g.
`…/dev-lead-reusable.yml@dev-lead/v1-stable`). That channel resolves to a *specific commit*, and the
stub may only forward (`with:`) inputs that the reusable **at that commit** declares under
`workflow_call.inputs`. Forwarding an input the pinned channel's commit does not yet declare is a
**channel-skew defect** (#1052): the reusable call fails at runtime with an "unexpected input" error
even though every ref looks valid, because the stub is ahead of the channel it pins.

- **Rule.** Never add or modify a `with:` forward on a channel-pinned caller stub to pass an input the
  pinned channel does not yet declare. This is the mirror image of the mutable-ref exception above: the
  channel tag is *deliberately* allowed to lag the reusable's `main`, so the stub must forward against
  what the channel currently resolves to, not against what `main` will eventually ship.
- **Sequencing for a new `workflow_call` input (in order):**
  1. **Land it in the reusable** — add the input to `workflow_call.inputs` on `main` and merge.
  2. **Promote the pinned channel** to a commit that declares it via
     `cut-release.sh <agent> <version> --channel <name>` (cuts the immutable `vX.Y.Z` and moves the
     `<name>` channel tag to it).
  3. **Only then teach the stub to forward it** — add the `with:` line to the caller stub, now that the
     pinned channel resolves to a commit that declares the input.

  Doing these out of order (forwarding first) is exactly the skew this rule prevents.
- **Enforcement.** The dev-lead prompt guardrail (part C, #1254) stops the agent from introducing the
  skew at the source; the **Part A CI guard (#1253)** is the belt-and-braces check that fails a PR whose
  caller-stub `with:` forwards an input the pinned channel does not declare.
- **Promotion.** The canonical org-wide version of this rule is tracked for
  [`petry-projects/.github`](https://github.com/petry-projects/.github/blob/main/standards/ci-standards.md)
  (`standards/ci-standards.md`, "Reusable workflow versioning — the `stable` channel") in
  petry-projects/.github#736; consumer repos defer to it once it lands.
