# reviewer_report.sh — org-wide Third-Party Reviewer Scorecard.
#
# Measures the agentic third-party code reviewers (GitHub Apps) that participate
# in PR review across the org and renders a DETERMINISTIC weekly Markdown report.
# No LLM is
# used anywhere in this pipeline: every metric is computed with jq/awk/bash from
# GitHub's own review data. (An LLM narrative is a deliberately separate, human-
# triggered add-on — not part of this script.)
#
# Why org-wide: the reviewer bots run as GitHub Apps installed at the org level
# and review PRs in every product repo, so a single-repo scan sees only a sliver
# of their activity. We sweep every non-archived repo, matching token_report.sh.
#
# Data source: ONE batched GraphQL query per repo (paginated over PRs, newest
# first) returns each PR's reviews, review threads (with resolution state and
# reactions), and issue comments in a single round-trip — far fewer calls than
# per-PR REST. Bot identity comes from the shared advisory-review-gate registry;
# rate-limit / out-of-quota notices are detected with its shared body pattern.
#
# Layout (mirrors token_report.sh):
#   * The render_* / aggregate helpers are PURE — they read a directory of
#     normalized JSONL and write Markdown to stdout. Unit-tested in
#     tests/reviewer_report.bats (no network).
#   * main() does the network I/O: repo discovery, GraphQL collection, and the
#     week-over-week snapshot fetch/publish.
#
# Usage:
#   ORG=petry-projects LOOKBACK_DAYS=7 GH_TOKEN=<pat> bash scripts/reviewer_report.sh > report.md
#
# Environment:
#   ORG                 — GitHub org to scan (default: petry-projects)
#   LOOKBACK_DAYS       — rolling window of PR activity to include (default: 7)
#   GH_TOKEN            — PAT with repo read across the org (PRs + reviews)
#   REVIEWER_REPORT_OUT — optional path; when set, the report is ALSO written there.
#   REVIEWER_SNAPSHOT_OUT — optional path; when set, the current week's per-bot
#                         headline metrics are written there as JSON (uploaded by
#                         the workflow as an artifact for next week's WoW diff).
#   REVIEWER_PREV_SNAPSHOT — optional path to last week's snapshot JSON; when set
#                         (and readable), the report shows week-over-week deltas.
#                         main() fetches this automatically via the GitHub API when
#                         SNAPSHOT_REPO is set; pass it directly in tests.
#   SNAPSHOT_REPO       — repo holding the snapshot artifacts (default: this repo,
#                         petry-projects/.github-private).
#   GH_OP_TIMEOUT       — per-gh-call timeout in seconds (default 60). 0 disables.
#   COLLECT_CONCURRENCY — max concurrent per-repo GraphQL sweeps (default 8).
#   MAX_PR_PAGES        — safety cap on GraphQL PR pages per repo (default 20 ×25 PRs).
