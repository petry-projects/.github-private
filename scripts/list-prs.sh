# Enumerate open, non-draft PRs the agent should consider reviewing.
#
# Searches across:
#   1. All open PRs in repos owned by $BOT_USER (the bot's personal account)
#   2. All open PRs in repos owned by $TARGET_ORG (organization)
#   3. All open PRs in additional orgs listed in $DELEGATION_ORGS
#
# Filters:
#   --draft=false       — skip work-in-progress PRs
#
# CI filtering is intentionally omitted here — review-one-pr.sh enforces it
# per-PR as a second layer. Filtering by --checks success would exclude repos
# with no CI configured (GitHub treats "no checks" as not matching --checks
# success), causing their PRs to never enter the candidate pool.
#
# Self-authored PRs (PRs whose author is $BOT_USER) are excluded here, because
# GitHub's GraphQL API rejects self-approval unconditionally — including such a
# PR in the queue previously triggered a fatal session abort that starved every
# subsequent candidate (see issue #96).
#
# Output ordering (stable, deterministic):
#   1. .github and .github-private PRs first (priority 0)
#   2. All other repos (priority 1)
#   Within each priority tier, PRs are sorted oldest-first by createdAt.
#
# Filters:
#   --draft=false       — skip work-in-progress PRs
#   --checks success    — only include PRs where all CI checks are green;
#                         failing or pending CI PRs are excluded here so they
#                         never consume a review slot. review-one-pr.sh also
#                         enforces this per-PR as a second layer of defence.
#
# Note: Uses repo enumeration instead of @me/@review-requested, which don't work
# with GitHub App tokens (app tokens have no user identity).
#
# Output: one PR URL per line on stdout.
