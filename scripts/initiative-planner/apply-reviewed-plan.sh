# apply-reviewed-plan.sh — apply a maintainer-REVIEWED plan.json WITHOUT re-planning.
#
# The plan/apply split (#604): a dry-run uploads an authoritative plan.json
# artifact; a maintainer reviews it; then the apply run is pointed at THAT
# artifact instead of asking the LLM to plan again. This script is the
# apply-side handoff — it never invokes the BMAD Scrum Master. What the
# maintainer reviewed is what materializes.
#
# It does exactly two things, in order:
#   1. Re-validate the supplied plan with validate-plan.py
#      — we never apply an unvalidated artifact.
#   2. Hand it to apply-plan.sh, which owns all materialization (incl. the
#      blocking-open-questions gate, the idempotency/supersede guard, and the
#      `initiative:auto` invariant). DRY_RUN is honored throughout.
#
# Env (PLAN_PATH consumed here; the rest are passed straight through to
# apply-plan.sh — see its header): PLAN_PATH (required), REPO, DISCUSSION_NUMBER,
# DISCUSSION_NODE_ID, FORCE_REPLAN, DRY_RUN / DRY_RUN_LOG.
