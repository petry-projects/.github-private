# route-findings.sh — fold UNRESOLVED plan-critic findings into a plan.json's
# open_questions (issue #603, epic #597 Phase 2).
#
# The bounded critic pass (prompts/plan-review.md, scoring the fixed rubric from
# prompts/bmad/scrum-master.md) emits structured findings. Bob folds the findings
# he can resolve back into plan.json directly. The findings he CANNOT resolve are
# passed to this helper, which appends one open_questions object per finding so
# they gate per the open-questions-as-gate mechanism (#682) and name which stories
# they concern (affected_story_ids).
#
# This is a pure, deterministic transform — no LLM, no network. Resolvability is
# Bob's judgement (which findings he passes here); the mapping below is fixed:
#   - question            <- "[<check>] <finding>"
#   - affected_story_ids  <- [story_id] (or [] when story_id is null / epic-level)
#   - blocking            <- true for major|critical findings, false otherwise
#                            (major/critical => the idea is not yet plannable; it
#                            halts materialization until a human answers — #682)
#
# Pre-existing open_questions on the plan are preserved; routed questions are
# appended after them.
#
# Usage:   route-findings.sh <plan.json> <unresolved-findings.json>
# Output:  the updated plan JSON on stdout (caller redirects, then re-validates
#          with validate-plan.py).
#
# The findings JSON is the critic's output shape (see prompts/plan-review.md):
#   { "findings": [ { "check", "story_id", "severity", "finding" }, ... ] }
