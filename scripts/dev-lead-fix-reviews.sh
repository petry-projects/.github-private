# resolve_actor_outdated_threads: best-effort safety net for the no-changes path.
# Resolves any open review threads on this PR that are isOutdated AND authored by ACTOR
# (matched against both the raw ACTOR string and ACTOR with any "[bot]" suffix stripped,
# since GitHub Actions includes the suffix but GraphQL author.login does not).
# Outdated threads reference code that no longer exists, so resolution is unambiguously
# safe. Independent of whether the agent decided to resolve them.
#
# RESOLVE-GUARD (#1415). dev-lead acts as the owner `don-petry` — the SAME account a
# human maintainer uses — so ACTOR-authored is NOT sufficient to prove a thread is
# ours: a maintainer's inline review left as `don-petry` matches the ACTOR filter
# exactly (this is the PR #1413 shape). Login cannot discriminate a maintainer from
# the agent here, so when the author is maintainer-capable — NOT one of the advisory/
# automation bots (review_thread_login_is_excluded_bot) and NOT our own bot login —
# each candidate is additionally gated on the automation MARKER in its originating
# comment via review_thread_is_agent_authored(): a marker-less thread is a maintainer
# finding and is SKIPPED with a visible ::warning:: rather than silently resolved.
# The guard uses the SAME maintainer definition as check_maintainer_review_threads
# (marker-less AND non-excluded-bot AND non-bot_user), so an outdated advisory-bot
# thread (e.g. codex/coderabbit) stays freely resolvable — only a genuine maintainer
# finding is held back. This is the review-path application of #860 rule 2 — "a gate
# whose reset is reachable by the agent is not a gate" — to review/merge gates
# (docs/agentic-interaction-model.md).
#
# ACTOR is passed to jq via --arg (not shell interpolation) so a hostile actor value
# can't escape the filter. reviewThreads(first:100) is the GraphQL max for a single
# page — PRs with >100 review threads will still leave some outdated ones unresolved,

    #   workflows that happen to share a job name are kept as separate entries.
    #   id is always present and monotonically increasing, so it reliably picks
    #   the newest run even when started_at is absent (e.g. queued runs).
    # Stage 2: drop cancelled/timed_out runs when a newer run (higher id, same
    #   name+app) has a terminal non-cancelled conclusion. This collapses a
    #   concurrency-cancelled run from an earlier suite once its replacement
    #   succeeds, without hiding a genuinely failing check from a distinct
    #   workflow. A lone cancelled/timed_out run (no newer replacement) still
    #   counts as a Tier-1 blocker (issue #461).

    # run is superseded by a run from a *different* event, which always lives
    # in a *different* check suite (the PR #453 incident shape), so requiring
    # suite equality here would never drop anything and would reintroduce the
    # endless 30-minute retry loop. The check-runs API exposes no workflow
    # identity, so a cancelled check from a sibling workflow sharing a
    # name+app with a newer success is also dropped — accepted trade-off:
    # GitHub's own required-check gate keys on the latest same-named run
    # (PR #453 merged with stale cancelled `review` runs still on its head
    # SHA), so such a PR is not actually merge-blocked. Failures are exempt
    # from Stage 2 (conservative: a real failure from a sibling workflow
    # stays visible to the agent even when GitHub would let the merge pass).

# resolved. A *skip* reply carries no marker, so it is never auto-resolved.
#
# Scope guard (#1415): only BOT-originated threads are touched (originating comment

# (BOT_USER, [bot]-suffix-stripped) posted it, so a marker-bearing reply from any other
# human or bot cannot resolve a bot thread; and (b) a reply that landed after enumeration
# is re-checked, so concurrent maintainer feedback can't be resolved against a stale

# resolve_dispositioned_comments: the issue-comment sibling of
# resolve_addressed_bot_threads (#1813). A PR *issue comment* (from `gh pr comment`
# or the GitHub main comment box) creates no review thread, so it is invisible to
# the thread-resolution path above. The maintainer-comment gate withholds
# pr-review's approval while ANY non-agent issue comment lacks a VERIFIED
# DISPOSITION, surfaced server-side as the comment being minimized RESOLVED. This
# net supplies that signal: for each undispositioned non-agent comment it locates
# dev-lead's single disposition reply, VERIFIES the disposition against ground
# truth (the pushed diff for `fixed`, the tracking issue for `out-of-scope`, a
# non-empty evidence reply for invalid/answered/informational), and — when
# cdv_authorize permits — minimizes the ORIGINAL comment RESOLVED (never the
# model; the harness alone resolves, #1813 AC4).
#
# Authorship (#1813 AC5): is_human is the server's own classification
# (author.__typename == "User"). A human maintainer's comment is auto-resolved
# ONLY on a verified `fixed` (an agent can never dismiss a person's finding by
# arguing it away); a bot's comment resolves on any verified disposition.
#
# Loop safety (#860 / AC7): candidate enumeration excludes our own account and any
# comment carrying an agent marker (which includes the `dev-lead:comment-disposition`
# reply itself), so our replies are never themselves treated as findings. The pass
# is idempotent — an already-minimized comment is filtered out — and every decision
# is delegated to the pure cdv_*/acv_* verifiers so it fails closed on any ambiguity.
# fbc_target_resolved: prints "yes" when the comment this fix-bot-comment pass was
# dispatched for (COMMENT_NODE_ID) is now minimized RESOLVED, "no" when it is not,
# and "unknown" when its state cannot be read. A pass that ends without a verified
# disposition for its comment must not post a terminal marker: the #2017 retry
# reads that marker as "this pass completed on the comment" and would never
# re-dispatch it, stranding the comment at the maintainer gate.

# resolution_gate_open <cp_rc> — the #1617 gate that wires the pure #1609
# head-movement predicate (ri_may_resolve) into the resolve_* review-thread nets.
# A dev-lead fix pass may auto-resolve review threads ONLY when it advanced the PR
# head; a pass that produced no commit resolves zero threads. This closes the #1024
# vector where a no-commit pass resolved 18 threads (incl. a Critical finding) purely
# on reply markers. Returns 0 (gate open — resolution permitted) / non-zero (closed).
#
# - Dry-run passes through so the announce-only nets keep announcing what they would
#   resolve — that existing behaviour and its tests are preserved.
# - Otherwise compares the immutable pre-pass RESOLUTION_BASE_SHA (snapshotted right
#   after the worktree checkout, before any work) against the post-pass
#   `git rev-parse HEAD` via ri_may_resolve (fail-closed: an empty or unchanged SHA
#   closes the gate). RESOLUTION_BASE_SHA — not HEAD_SHA — is used deliberately:
#   HEAD_SHA is the event-time value and is reassigned by try_enable_auto_merge, so
#   gating on it could open on a no-commit pass whose checkout drifted from the event.
# - Falls back to cp_rc == 0 ONLY when a SHA is genuinely unavailable (base snapshot
#   unset or `git rev-parse HEAD` unresolvable), so a pass that legitimately pushed a
#   commit is never wrongly gated shut just because the runner cannot report a SHA.
