# post-skill-score.sh — pass/score output channel for the skill_candidate
# artifact type (issue #615, epic #610 Phase 2).
#
# This is the skill_candidate half of the review artifact contract's
# output_channel: the rubric registry (scripts/lib/review-registry.tsv) maps
# artifact_type skill_candidate -> {rubric: prompts/skill-review.md,
# output_channel: THIS script}.
#
# Unlike the pr_diff channel (scripts/post-pr-review.sh, which posts a GitHub PR
# review), a candidate skill edit is consumed by Epic #581's strict-improvement
# GATE, not a human on a PR. So this channel delivers the review brain's verdict
# as a MACHINE-READABLE pass/fail + numeric score the gate can consume. It NEVER
# posts a GitHub review and NEVER calls post-pr-review.sh.
#
# Inputs:
#   $1 — content_ref: the candidate skill edit (diff or file) path that was
#        reviewed (for the log line).
#   $2 — score JSON path: the rubric's output (see prompts/skill-review.md).
#   $3 — DRY_RUN (true/false). The score is a local artifact, so delivery is the
#        same either way; the flag is accepted for output-channel contract
#        symmetry with post-pr-review.sh / post-plan-findings.sh and surfaced in
#        the log.
#
# Env:
#   SKILL_SCORE_OUTPUT — optional destination path. When set, the validated score
#        JSON is written there for the strict-improvement gate to consume. When
#        unset, the verdict/score are summarized to stdout only.
#
# Score JSON shape (emitted by prompts/skill-review.md):
#   {
#     "artifact_type": "skill_candidate",
#     "verdict": "pass|fail",
#     "score": 0.0-1.0,
#     "summary": "...",
#     "findings": [ { "severity","category","message","location" } ]
#   }
#
# Exit codes: 0 on a well-formed pass/fail verdict with an in-range score;
# non-zero when the score file is missing, unparseable, carries an unknown
# verdict, or a non-numeric / out-of-range score.
