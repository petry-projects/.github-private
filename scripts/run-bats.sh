# run-bats.sh — resilient wrapper around `bats` for the lint.yml `bats` job.
#
# Plain `bats <file> ...` aborts the whole run (executing zero tests) the moment
# one listed path is missing — so a single not-yet-present test file on a feature
# branch turns the entire CI job red with no test signal at all.
#
# This wrapper instead runs every listed file that exists, emits a GitHub
# `::warning::` annotation for any that is missing, and fails only when a real
# test fails or when none of the listed files exist.
#
# Usage: run-bats.sh <test-file> [<test-file> ...]
