# sweep-stuck-reviews.sh — re-trigger reviews for PRs that went green after a skip.
#
# The pr-review cascade legitimately SKIPS a PR whose CI is pending or failing
# (decision: skip, reason: ci-pending | ci-failing) and relies on a later
# `check_suite:completed` event to re-evaluate it. But when CI settles green
# AFTER the last review trigger fired — common while dev-lead is actively
# pushing fixes / re-running CI — no event re-fires, and the PR sits at
# REVIEW_REQUIRED with green CI, never re-reviewed (issue #573).
#
# This sweep closes that gap. It enumerates open PRs and re-dispatches a review
# for each one that is:
#   • reviewDecision == REVIEW_REQUIRED   (GitHub still wants a review), AND
#   • CI status == passing                (own pr-review checks filtered out via
#                                          lib/ci-status.sh, same as the cascade), AND
#   • NOT already reviewed at the current head
#                                         (no `<!-- pr-review-agent v1 sha=<head> -->`
#                                          marker), so genuine no-ops aren't re-fired.
# Each selected PR is re-dispatched through the normal trigger
# (pr-review-trigger.yml -f pr_url=<url>); review-one-pr.sh remains the
# authoritative gate, so the sweep only decides WHAT to re-trigger.
#
# IMPORTANT — the re-dispatch requires a PAT, not GITHUB_TOKEN:
#   GitHub does not start new workflow runs from a workflow_dispatch fired with
#   the default GITHUB_TOKEN (loop prevention). The caller MUST provide a PAT
#   with workflow scope as GH_TOKEN. Same constraint as
#   scripts/initiative-planner/redispatch.sh.
#
# Env:
#   AGENT_REPO        owner/repo hosting the trigger workflow (default: petry-projects/.github-private)
#   TRIGGER_WORKFLOW  workflow file to dispatch (default: pr-review-trigger.yml)
#   SWEEP_PRS_FILE    optional file of candidate PR URLs (one per line); when
#                     unset, candidates are enumerated via list-prs.sh
#   MAX_DISPATCH      cap on review dispatches per sweep (default: 20)
#   DRY_RUN           "true"/"1" → log selections but never dispatch
#   GITHUB_REF        passed through as --ref when it is a branch/tag (feature testing)
#   GH_TOKEN          a PAT with workflow scope (required at the call site)
