# persona_reach_check.sh — consumer-reached / no-new-trigger-surface verification
# for a mention-routed persona (#1631, epic #1627).
#
# Usage:
#   persona_reach_check.sh <role> [--registry FILE] [--personas-dir DIR] [--router FILE]
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# A ring label moving is NOT evidence that a promotion reached a consumer
# (Discussion #1360 learning 12; the #1592 propagation hazard). solution-architect
# carries no dedicated reusable blob — its advisory logic is a prompt file served by
# the SHARED persona-mention router (.github/workflows/persona-mention.yml), whose
# channel the router already owns and cuts. Autocut only cuts a new channel version
# when a REUSABLE's blob changes, so a status/ring move on a prompt-only persona can
# advance the scoreboard yet propagate to nobody. Promotion therefore has to be
# verified two ways this guard encodes, hermetically and re-runnably:
#
#   1. NO NEW TRIGGER SURFACE (AC #5). The persona's DEPLOYED interaction events must
#      stay a subset of the shared mention router's events — promotion must not add a
#      pull_request:synchronize, a cron, or any fan-out that would turn an advisor
#      into a queue (§7 of the story body, learning 11).
#   2. ROUTES-TO != PROMOTED (AC #4). The verdict separates "a mention would route to
#      this persona" (wiring) from "this persona is actually promoted" (status past
#      draft, with NO cross-repo canary-rings entry — see ADR-0006). The dangerous
#      state is now the INVERSE: a canary-rings entry for a persona that has no
#      dedicated reusable, which produces unconsumed tags and an unattributable
#      gate. That, or a widened trigger surface, is what this guard fails on.
#
# The truly-live confirmation (dispatch a real @petry-projects/solution-architect
# mention and confirm the resulting persona-runner run resolves to this persona,
# mirroring qa-lead's #1300 mention smoke test) is an operational step run against a
# real consumer; this guard is the hermetic, offline core that gates the wiring and
# catches the skew at PR time.
#
# Following ADR-0004 (pure-logic + bats), the predicates below are pure and
# unit-tested BEFORE the guard is relied on (tests/persona_reach_check.bats); main()
# confines all I/O (reading manifests, the router, an optional registry, printing).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  safe state — either an honest still-draft persona, or a promoted persona
#      (past draft, UNREGISTERED per ADR-0006) whose surface stayed mention-only.
#   2  DEFECT / new surface — a canary-rings entry exists for this shared-runtime
#      persona at any status (ADR-0006 forbids it), or promotion added a trigger
#      surface beyond the shared mention router.
#   3  hard error — bad usage / missing inputs.

# The shared persona-mention router's DEPLOYED trigger events (persona-standards §4.1;
# .github/workflows/persona-mention.yml `on:` block). Anything a persona subscribes
# beyond this set is a NEW trigger surface introduced during promotion.

# The routes-to != promoted predicate (learning 12), INVERTED per ADR-0006
# (docs/architecture/adr/0006-shared-runtime-personas-are-not-ring-registered.md).
#
# This persona rides the SHARED persona runtime: persona-runner.yml consumes the
# reusable by local relative path with no agent_ref, so NO caller pins a
# per-persona channel tag. There is nothing for a ring promotion to advance, and
# ADR-0006 therefore forbids a per-persona canary-rings entry outright — "a
# registered persona ID is a defect, not a promotion."
#
# So the state this guard used to fail on is now the NORMAL one, and the state it
# used to treat as safe is now the defect:
#   draft      — status is draft and unregistered: not promoted (safe, 0)
#   promoted   — status past draft and NOT registered: the ADR-0006 shape (safe, 0)
#   registered — registered at ANY status: forbidden for a shared-runtime persona,
#                the inverted skew (2). Checked before the draft branch, because a
#                draft persona carrying a registry entry is equally a defect.
#
# Promotion evidence is this check plus an observed live mention — never a ring
# label. That was already true; ADR-0006 removes the label that was never evidence.
