# auto-rebase-retry.sh — self-heal a failed Auto-rebase workflow run.
#
# The Auto-rebase workflow handles *merge conflicts* gracefully (it posts a
# sentinel comment that dev-lead's `rebase` intent then resolves). But when the
# run itself fails — a transient GitHub API error, a rate-limit, an infra
# hiccup — no sentinel is posted and nothing retries it. This handler closes
# that gap: on a failed run it re-runs the failed jobs, bounded by the run's
# attempt counter so a deterministically-broken run cannot loop forever. When
# the attempt cap is reached it stops retrying and surfaces a warning so a
# human can intervene.
#
# Bounding works without external state: `gh run rerun --failed` increments the
# run's attempt counter, and each completed re-run fires another workflow_run
# event, so RUN_ATTEMPT naturally climbs toward MAX_ATTEMPTS. (Chaining past the
# first retry requires GH_PAT_WORKFLOWS — re-runs requested via the default
# GITHUB_TOKEN do not re-fire workflow_run events.)
#
# Env inputs:
#   CONCLUSION    — github.event.workflow_run.conclusion
#   RUN_ID        — github.event.workflow_run.id
#   RUN_ATTEMPT   — github.event.workflow_run.run_attempt (defaults to 1)
#   WORKFLOW_NAME — github.event.workflow_run.name (logging only)
#   HTML_URL      — github.event.workflow_run.html_url (logging only)
#   REPO          — owner/repo (defaults to GITHUB_REPOSITORY)
#   MAX_ATTEMPTS  — give up after this many attempts (default: 3)
#   DRY_RUN       — if "true", log intent but do not call gh (default: false)
#   GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY — path for the run summary (optional)
#
# Manual workflow_dispatch inputs (#1890 AC #4/#5):
#   GITHUB_EVENT_NAME — "workflow_dispatch" selects the manual conflict-recovery
#                       path instead of the automatic failed-run retry
#   PR_NUMBER         — the PR stuck in CONFLICTING/DIRTY to route into the
#                       dev-lead `rebase` intent
#
# Always exits 0: a handler failure would itself be noise. Outcomes are surfaced
# via ::notice:: / ::warning:: annotations and the step summary instead.

# ── manual conflict recovery (workflow_dispatch, #1890 AC #4/#5) ───────────────
# The workflow_run path self-heals a *failed run*. This path is the hand-crank an
# operator uses for a PR that is stuck CONFLICTING/DIRTY even though its
# Auto-rebase run *succeeded* — the conflict-only sentinel never had a
# manually-invocable surface. It fires a `dev-lead-reviews-retry`
# repository_dispatch (the same bridge the conflict sentinel uses) carrying the
# PR number and intent=rebase, so the PR is routed straight into dev-lead's
# rebase intent. A PAT is required for the dispatch to trigger the workflow.
