# caller_stub_freeze.sh — stub-freeze drift guard for the ring-0 / self-host
# caller stubs (#1255, epic #1052 Part B). Backstops the #1253
# validate-caller-inputs check for the specific self-host caller stubs whose
# reusable is hosted in THIS repo and pinned to a canary channel tag.
#
# WHY (channel skew, #1034): `pull_request` CI runs the BASE-branch caller stub,
# and GitHub validates a reusable's inputs only at startup against the PINNED
# ref — so a trigger/input-forwarding change to a channel-pinned caller stub is
# exercised by nothing in PR CI and only breaks post-merge. Part A (#1253)
# resolves same-repo channel tags and validates inputs ⊆ declared inputs. This
# part adds a stronger, byte-identity BACKSTOP for the self-host stubs: each
# stub's trigger (`on:`) + `uses:`/`with:` forwarding block must stay
# byte-identical to a committed baseline (tests/fixtures/caller-stub-freeze/
# *.block). Any edit to a frozen block fails CI unless the baseline is
# intentionally regenerated in the same reviewed diff (an explicit channel
# change), converting a silent post-merge break into a deliberate decision.
#
# It REUSES the byte-identity drift model from fleet_stub_drift.sh:
#   classify_stub_drift <baseline_sha> <current_sha> -> ALIGNED|DRIFTED|MISSING
#   stub_drift_row <file> <baseline_sha> <current_sha>
# The "baseline" SHA is the git blob SHA of the committed .block fixture; the
# "current" SHA is the git blob SHA of the block extracted from the live stub.
# Equal blob SHAs ⇒ byte-identical forwarding blocks ⇒ the stub is still frozen.
#
# All functions here are PURE (no network): they read in-repo files / SHAs and
# write to stdout, exactly like fleet_stub_drift.sh / template_stub_drift.sh.
#
# Drift TSV format (4 fields, tab-separated), shared with fleet_stub_drift.sh:
#   1:file  2:status  3:current_sha  4:baseline_sha
