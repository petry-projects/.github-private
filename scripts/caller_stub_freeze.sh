# caller_stub_freeze.sh — stub-freeze drift guard for the ring-0 / self-host
# caller stubs (#1255, epic #1052 Part B). Backstops the #1253
# validate-caller-inputs check for the specific self-host caller stubs whose
# reusable is hosted in THIS repo and pinned to a canary channel tag.
#
# WHY (channel skew, #1034): `pull_request` CI runs the BASE-branch caller stub,
# and GitHub validates a reusable's inputs only at startup against the PINNED
# ref — so a trigger/input-forwarding change to a channel-pinned caller stub is
# exercised by nothing in PR CI and only breaks post-merge. Part A (#1253)
# resolves same-repo channel tags and validates inputs ⊆ declared inputs. This
# part adds a stronger, byte-identity BACKSTOP for the self-host stubs: each
# stub's trigger (`on:`) + `uses:`/`with:` forwarding block must stay
# byte-identical to a committed baseline (tests/fixtures/caller-stub-freeze/
# *.block). Any edit to a frozen block fails CI unless the baseline is
# intentionally regenerated in the same reviewed diff (an explicit channel
# change), converting a silent post-merge break into a deliberate decision.
#
# It REUSES the byte-identity drift model from fleet_stub_drift.sh:
#   classify_stub_drift <baseline_sha> <current_sha> -> ALIGNED|DRIFTED|MISSING
#   stub_drift_row <file> <baseline_sha> <current_sha>
# The "baseline" SHA is the git blob SHA of the committed .block fixture; the
# "current" SHA is the git blob SHA of the block extracted from the live stub.
# Equal blob SHAs ⇒ byte-identical forwarding blocks ⇒ the stub is still frozen.
#
# All functions here are PURE (no network): they read in-repo files / SHAs and
# write to stdout, exactly like fleet_stub_drift.sh / template_stub_drift.sh.
#
# Drift TSV format: fleet_stub_drift.sh's 4 fields plus a 5th job column added
# here so a multi-job agent-ingress.yml (ADR-0007) yields one row per collapsed
# role (#1725):
#   1:file  2:status  3:current_sha  4:baseline_sha  5:job

# ── Covered-stub manifest ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Each row: "stub_path|job|baseline_name" — the ring-0 / self-host caller stubs
# whose reusable lives in petry-projects/.github-private and is pinned to a canary
# channel tag (docs/initiatives/agentic-release-strategy.md §5). These are the
# stubs Part A can least afford to get wrong (a broken forwarding change here
# breaks the source repo's own automation post-merge), so they are frozen.
#
# The manifest is per-role/per-JOB (#1725): the middle field names the job whose
# forwarding block is frozen. Today these are three single-job per-role stubs; on
# the collapse (epic #1723) each collapsed role becomes a job row against the one
# agent-ingress.yml — the same job-scoped extractor covers both shapes, so this
# guard lands BEFORE the collapse without breaking current CI.

# extract_forwarding_block <stub_file> <job> — emit the frozen region of a caller
# stub for a NAMED job (#1725, job-scoped): the top-level `on:` trigger block,
# followed by that job's channel-pinned `uses:` line, its `with:` forwarding
# block, and its `permissions:` block. `if:`, `secrets:`, `name:`, and job-body
# comments before the first captured child are excluded. Pure: reads the file,
# writes stdout.
#
# WHY job-scoped: the pre-#1725 extractor assumed ONE top-level `on:` and the
# FIRST job-indented `uses:` — it collapses on a multi-job agent-ingress.yml (one
# shared `on:`, many `uses:`), forwarding the wrong job's block. Selecting by job
# name lets one guard freeze both a single-job per-role stub and one job of the
# collapsed ingress, so the guard survives the collapse (epic #1723).
#
# WHY permissions is now frozen: in the ingress each job re-grants its own
# least-privilege `permissions:` (a reusable can be granted no more than its
# calling job). A silent permission escalation on a channel-pinned job is exactly
# the invisible-to-PR-CI change (#1034 class) this backstop exists to catch.
#
# Boundaries (deterministic, byte-identity friendly):
#   - `on:` block: the `on:` line plus every following indented line, blank line,
#     or column-0 comment; it ends at the next non-blank, non-comment, column-0
#     line (the next top-level YAML key). Blanks and column-0 comments are kept so
#     a new trigger cannot hide after a blank line or comment (#1268).
#   - job block: within `jobs:`, the named job's `uses:`/`with:`/`permissions:`
#     direct children and their nested lines, in document order, until the next
#     job key (or a dedent to the job-key indent) ends it. Trailing blank lines
#     are dropped; blanks/comments interior to a captured sub-block are kept.
