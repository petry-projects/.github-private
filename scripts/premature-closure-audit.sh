# premature-closure-audit.sh — premature-closure backstop audit (issue #1077).
#
# #1077: the dev-lead agent closed tracking issues as `completed` without the fix
# actually landing on `main` — the issue closed on task-attempt, but the problem
# it described was still present and no merged PR resolved it. This audit is the
# machine-checkable post-condition (recommended action #3): it scans recently
# closed issues and flags any closed as `completed` shortly after opening with
# NO merged closing PR.
#
# Staged like stale-manager: DRY_RUN (default) writes a report only. In live mode
# (DRY_RUN=false) it RE-OPENS each flagged issue, applies the `dev-lead:needs-human`
# label, and posts one idempotent comment — turning a silently-"done" issue back
# into a visibly-open, human-routed one (recommended action #2). Fail-SAFE: if
# whether a merged closing PR exists cannot be determined, the issue is NOT
# flagged, so the audit never re-opens on an undeterminable lookup.
#
# The detection thresholds live in scripts/lib/premature-closure-detect.sh.
#
# Env vars consumed:
#   GH_TOKEN            — repo read (issues + timeline); issues:write in live mode
#   GH_PAT_FALLBACK     — optional secondary token if the primary can't read REPO
#   REPO / AGENT_REPO   — target repo (default: petry-projects/.github-private)
#   DRY_RUN             — "true" (default) reports only; "false" applies actions
#   PC_LOOKBACK_DAYS    — how far back to scan closed issues (default: 7)
#   PC_MAX_OPEN_MINUTES — the "closed within N minutes of open" window (default: 30)
#   NEEDS_HUMAN_LABEL   — escalation label (default: dev-lead:needs-human)
#   GITHUB_ENV / GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY — written by the Actions runner
