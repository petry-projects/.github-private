# pr_review_canary.sh — post-merge canary for the ring-0 pr-review-trigger stub.
#
# Implements #1256 (epic #1052 Part D). pr-review-trigger.yml is a self-host
# (ring-0) caller stub: it pins the reusable at a canary channel tag
# (`pr-review.yml@pr-review/next`) and forwards `with:` inputs to it. GitHub
# validates a reusable's inputs only at startup, against the PINNED ref — so a
# `with:`-forwarding change that forwards an input the pinned channel does not
# yet declare (the #1034 channel-skew defect) is exercised by NOTHING in PR CI
# and only breaks post-merge, where the dispatched run ends in `startup_failure`.
#
# What it does: fires a DRY-RUN dispatch of pr-review-trigger.yml (dry_run=true
# — the reusable submits no reviews/comments), waits for the resulting
# workflow_dispatch run, and fails LOUD if it concludes `startup_failure` (or any
# non-success), turning silent post-merge breakage into a gating signal. This is
# the manual dry-run that verified #1048's recovery, made continuous.
#
# Layout mirrors scripts/initiative_canary.sh:
#   * classify_canary_run / canary_is_failure / canary_report are PURE — they
#     take scalars and write stdout. Unit-tested in tests/pr_review_canary.bats.
#   * main() does the network I/O: dispatch, poll.
#
# Env vars consumed:
#   REPO                 owner/repo hosting the trigger (default petry-projects/.github-private)
#   WORKFLOW_FILE        trigger workflow to dispatch (default pr-review-trigger.yml)
#   GH_TOKEN             a PAT with workflow scope (a workflow_dispatch fired with
#                        GITHUB_TOKEN is accepted but never starts a run)
#   CANARY_POLL_TIMEOUT  seconds to wait for the run to complete (default 600)
#   CANARY_POLL_INTERVAL seconds between polls (default 15)
#   CANARY_OUT           optional path; the report is written there in addition to stdout
#   GITHUB_ENV           written by the Actions runner (CANARY_STATUS / CANARY_FAILED)

# skew is ruled out — a downstream FAILED (the dry-run review cascade failed
# against a real fleet PR for an unrelated reason) or NO_RUN (no completed run
# observed) is NOT this canary's signal and must not turn it red, or unrelated
# flakes raise false Fleet Monitor trackers (#1612). Exit 1 (no alert) otherwise.
