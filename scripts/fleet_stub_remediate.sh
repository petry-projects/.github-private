# fleet_stub_remediate.sh — pure remediation-plan builder for the Actions Fleet
# Monitor stub-drift remediation (#1149, epic #1148). Sourced (not executed) so
# bats can exercise the pure helpers, mirroring fleet_stub_drift.sh.
#
# The Fleet Monitor emits the DRIFTED enrolled-repo set as fleet_stub_drift.json
# (see stub_drift_alert_json / fleet_monitor.sh): an array of objects
#   { repo, status, repo_sha, canonical_sha, stub, stub_file }
# where `stub` is the stub label and `stub_file` is the per-repo thin-caller
# path. This module derives a network-free remediation PLAN from that set: for
# each DRIFTED entry it names the consumer repo, the stub, the per-repo
# stub_file, and the canonical source of record (CANONICAL_STUB_REPO + the
# stub's canonical_path from STUB_REGISTRY) — the exact bytes the detector
# compared against. The two tracked fleet stubs are deployed VERBATIM from that
# canonical path, so the canonical bytes ARE the remediation content (they must
# NOT be routed through seed-repo-template.sh --emit-workflow, whose manifest is
# the repo-template baseline set and which repins caller refs).
#
# ALIGNED and MISSING entries are excluded (only DRIFTED is remediable), and a
# never-overwrite REMEDIATION_ALLOWLIST drops intentionally-customized files so
# the remediation step can never overwrite them — mirroring template_stub_drift.sh's
# TEMPLATE_DRIFT_ALLOWLIST + its recorded-rationale rule.
#
# The plan-building helpers here are PURE (no network): they take a JSON file /
# SHAs and write to stdout. The Phase-2 network driver (#1150) is co-located
# below the pure section — reading canonical bytes and opening PRs — reached only
# from main() on a direct run, mirroring how seed-repo-template.sh co-locates
# pure helpers with a network main().
#
# Remediation plan format — a JSON array of objects:
#   { repo, stub, stub_file, canonical_repo, canonical_path }

# Canonical source of record for the tracked fleet stubs, mirroring
# fleet_monitor.sh. Kept here (rather than sourced from fleet_monitor.sh) because
# fleet_monitor.sh is the network driver — it executes on source and cannot be
# sourced purely. Each STUB_REGISTRY entry is TAB-separated:
#   name <TAB> label <TAB> stub_path <TAB> canonical_path
#     name           — slug used in log lines
#     label          — the `stub` value carried in fleet_stub_drift.json
#     stub_path      — the `stub_file` value carried in fleet_stub_drift.json
#     canonical_path — org-template path under $CANONICAL_STUB_REPO

# ── Never-overwrite allowlist (AC #3) ─────────────────────────────────────────
# Files that the remediation step must NEVER re-sync, because a consumer repo has
# intentionally customized them. An allowlisted entry never appears in the plan
# output, so the remediation can never touch it — mirroring template_stub_drift.sh's
# TEMPLATE_DRIFT_ALLOWLIST. Each entry is either:
#   "owner/repo"            — never remediate ANY tracked stub in that repo, or
#   "owner/repo|stub_file"  — never remediate that one stub_file in that repo.
# Add an entry ONLY with a recorded rationale (the same recorded-rationale rule
# AGENTS.md applies to the template ci.yml exception): name the repo/file and why
# the customization is deliberate, so the never-overwrite decision stays auditable.
# It is intentionally empty until a first deliberate customization is recorded —
# by default every DRIFTED fleet stub is a verbatim deployment and IS remediable.
