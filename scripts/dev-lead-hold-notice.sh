# dev-lead-hold-notice.sh — the I/O wrapper for the #1767 "held item" notice.
#
# dev-lead skips a work item carrying a hold label (needs-human-review /
# dev-lead:needs-human / dev-lead:hands-off) but says nothing on the item, so the
# skip is invisible outside the run log and the agent looks stalled (PR #1742 sat
# four days looking dead while it was correctly withholding action). This wrapper
# makes the withhold visible with exactly ONE comment, and re-arms cleanly.
#
# All decision logic is PURE and unit-tested in scripts/lib/hold-notice.sh
# (ADR-0004); this file does only I/O — list comments, post, edit — and never
# aborts the calling job on an API failure (best-effort, ::warning:: on trouble).
#
# Modes:
#   MODE=notice     (default) a hold-label skip: post the one-time notice for
#                   HOLD_LABEL if absent (idempotent), first collapsing any stale
#                   notice for a DIFFERENT label (the hold changed).
#   MODE=supersede  a pickup (dev-lead is acting): the item is no longer held, so
#                   collapse any live hold notice on it (re-arm, AC4).
#
# Env:
#   REPO            owner/repo (defaults to GITHUB_REPOSITORY)
#   SUBJECT_NUMBER  issue or PR number (issues + PRs share the issues comments API)
#   HOLD_LABEL      the blocking label (required for MODE=notice)
#   MODE            notice | supersede (default: notice)
#   NOTICE_AUTHOR   dev-lead's own account login (BOT_USER). Only comments
#                   authored by this account are treated as hold notices, so a
#                   user-authored comment that copies a notice marker can neither
#                   suppress a real notice nor be collapsed as if it were one. If
#                   empty, no comment is trusted as a notice (fail-closed: we may
#                   re-post but never act on a forged marker).
#   DEV_LEAD_DRY_RUN / DRY_RUN   "true" → log intent, make no write calls

#   control chars in a comment never break the shell pipeline (same guard as
#   post-pr-review.sh mark_prior_agent_items_obsolete). Only comments authored by
#   NOTICE_AUTHOR (dev-lead itself) are considered, so a user comment that copies
#   a notice marker is never rewritten as though it were our own notice.
