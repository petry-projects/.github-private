# check-duplicate-decls.sh — required CI gate against the #1485 corruption class.
#
# Fails when any scanned file carries the #1485 whole-block-duplication signature:
#   - scripts/**/*.sh   — the same top-level FUNCTION declared more than once.
#     Bash last-definition-wins semantics mean a duplicated function silently
#     shadows its earlier copies, so the test suite stays green while the file
#     content is wrong — the mechanism that let the #1292 and #1378 merges land
#     wholesale duplicated scripts on main (see #1485 for the incident record and
#     #1520 for this gate's story).
#   - prompts/**/*.md   — the same markdown HEADING repeated in a file. A prompt
#     that restates a "Phase 2/3/4" block twice instructs the agent to repeat the
#     phase; fix-ci.md (46 lines) and fix-reviews.md (20 lines) shipped exactly
#     this (#1779).
#   - personas/**/*.yml — the same KEY declared twice in one mapping. YAML
#     last-key-wins hides it from yaml.safe_load-based validators, and the moment
#     the two values diverge the first is silently discarded (persona.yml carried
#     a duplicate `reusable:` under `runtime:`, #1779).
#
# The md/yml scopes close the scan-scope gap filed as petry-projects/.github#1041
# (the shipped gate only ever looked at scripts/). This is that one gate widened,
# not a second gate.
#
# Deliberately narrow (#1520 AC, extended by #1779):
#   - Tree-state, not diff-aware: standing corruption fails, whoever introduced
#     it. The parent-aware introduction detector is lib/conflict-integrity.sh
#     on the rebase path (#1482); this gate is the merge-blocking backstop.
#   - Shell VARIABLE reassignment at column 0 is legitimate (defaults overwritten
#     conditionally), so var duplicates are not gated — functions only.
#   - YAML keys repeated across DIFFERENT list items or DIFFERENT mappings are not
#     duplicates and are not flagged (see extract_yaml_mapping_keys).
#   - A verified-benign duplicate heading is recorded in MD_HEADING_ALLOWLIST with
#     a rationale — the only escape hatch, and only for headings.
#
# Usage: check-duplicate-decls.sh [dir]
#   - No args: full repo scan — scripts/ (this file's dir), prompts/ and personas/.
#   - <dir>:   legacy mode — scan <dir> for duplicate .sh functions only. The md
#     and yml scans stay OFF unless DUPLICATE_DECL_PROMPTS_DIR /
#     DUPLICATE_DECL_PERSONAS_DIR name a directory, keeping .sh-only fixtures
#     isolated.
