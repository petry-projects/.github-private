# dev-lead-stale-base-audit.sh — bounded, READ-ONLY audit for the #1607
# stale-base defect across dev-lead's open PRs.
#
# The #1604 incident (a maintainer steering commit discarded by a stale-base
# force-push) leaves a fingerprint on the branch: the discarded commit and the
# commit that replaced it share the SAME parent. This wrapper enumerates the
# PRs dev-lead touches and, for each, pulls the branch's commit graph and checks
# it for that fingerprint via detect_stale_base_siblings. It never writes to any
# branch, PR, or ref — it only reports, so an operator can inspect flagged PRs.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dev-lead-stale-base-audit.sh                 # audit every open PR
#   scripts/dev-lead-stale-base-audit.sh owner/repo 123  # audit one PR
#
# Env: REPO / PR_NUMBER may substitute for positional args. BOT_USER / TARGET_ORG
# scope the full sweep (same defaults as list-prs.sh).
#
# Exit status: 0 when no fingerprint is found in any audited PR; 1 when at least
# one PR shows the stale-base sibling fingerprint (for CI gating / alerting).

  # activity log: every force_push on the PR's branch records its pre-push
  # `before` SHA. Append each discarded commit + its parent to the graph so
  # detect_stale_base_siblings can see the discarded/replacement pair sharing a
  # parent. Best-effort: a since-collected `before` commit simply 404s and is
  # skipped, which is still strictly better than never seeing the discard.
