# fleet_stub_drift.sh — initiative-planner stub coverage & drift detection for
# the Actions Fleet Monitor (#822, AC#2 + AC#3). Sourced by fleet_monitor.sh.
#
# The initiative-planner is adopted by fleet repos via a per-repo thin-caller
# stub at .github/workflows/initiative-planner.yml (#820), deployed verbatim
# from the canonical org template standards/workflows/initiative-planner.yml.
# This module compares each enrolled repo's stub blob SHA against the canonical
# template SHA and classifies coverage so the monitor can alert on drift — the
# silent-revert class of failure #822 exists to catch (cf. #655).
#
# All functions are PURE: they take a canonical SHA + a per-repo stub blob SHA
# (or a drift TSV) and write to stdout. No network. The blob SHAs are the values
# GitHub's contents API returns in `.sha` (git blob object IDs), so equal SHAs
# mean byte-identical files. Network fetching lives in fleet_monitor.sh.
#
# Drift TSV format (4 fields, tab-separated):
#   1:repo  2:status  3:repo_sha  4:canonical_sha
# status ∈ { ALIGNED, DRIFTED, MISSING }
#   ALIGNED — stub present and byte-identical to the canonical template
#   DRIFTED — stub present but its blob SHA differs (the alertable set)
#   MISSING — no stub in the repo (not enrolled) — informational, not alerted

# classify_stub_drift <canonical_sha> <repo_sha>
# Classifies one repo's stub against the canonical template SHA.

# ── Per-job (role-selector) extraction (#1726) ────────────────────────────────
# The per-role Class-1 caller stubs collapse into ONE agent-ingress.yml with
# EXACTLY ONE job per collapsed role (ADR-0007). A per-role file path 404s once
# collapsed, so whole-file blob-SHA detection reads every collapsed repo as
# MISSING ("not enrolled") and a whole-file compare against a single-role
# canonical is meaningless. These helpers move the comparison unit from the whole
# file to a single extracted job BLOCK, so drift and remediation understand the
# collapsed form. They are PURE: content in on stdin, text/SHA out on stdout.

# extract_job_block <job> — read a workflow YAML on stdin and print the lines of
# the `jobs.<job>:` block: the `  <job>:` key line (2-space indent) and every
# following line more deeply indented than the key (plus interior blank lines).
# The block ends at the first non-blank line indented ≤ 2 spaces (the next job
# key, a job's leading comment, or a top-level key), which is NOT printed. Empty
# output ⇒ the job is absent. Deterministic, so equal blocks ⇒ byte-identical.
