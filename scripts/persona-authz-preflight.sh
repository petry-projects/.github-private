# persona-authz-preflight.sh — non-destructive authorization preflight for the
# persona runner (#1776, split from #1734 AC #5).
#
# Runs in persona-runner-reusable.yml AFTER the posting identity is resolved and
# BEFORE the paid engine call, so an authenticated-but-unauthorized credential is
# caught before the model is invoked and the advisory is produced and lost — the
# strongest position (AC #3, option a). CI-only placement cannot catch runtime
# revocation and, lacking the cross-repo posting PATs, cannot run a live probe at
# all, so the runtime preflight is required regardless.
#
# The probe is NON-DESTRUCTIVE (AC #2): it never creates, edits, or deletes real
# content. It issues a single capability query — `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` — and
# reads `.permissions` (admin/maintain/push) for the authenticated posting
# identity. No throwaway comment/issue/branch is written anywhere.
#
# The DECISION is pure and unit-tested in scripts/lib/persona-authz-preflight.sh.
# This wrapper is the network + side-effect layer: gather the probe facts, map
# them to a decision, and act — fail CLOSED (exit 1, ::error::) only on a definite
# negative; fail OPEN (exit 0, ::warning::) on any indeterminate result (AC #4).
#
# Env vars consumed:
#   GH_TOKEN           — the posting PAT already selected from the manifest
#                        credential by the calling step (never a repo-wide
#                        default). EMPTY means the missing/invalid-secret case,
#                        which is handled earlier — the preflight skips (see below).
#   SOURCE_REPO        — owner/repo of the item the advisory would be posted to
#   POSTING_ACCOUNT    — the login GH_TOKEN authenticates as (from the manifest)
#   POSTING_CREDENTIAL — the secret name holding that PAT (from the manifest)
