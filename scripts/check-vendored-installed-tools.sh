# check-vendored-installed-tools.sh — narrow guard (#1541, split from #1468 AC 3)
# against the #1449 failure class.
#
# Fails when a tool this repo's CI installs via a package manager
# (`apt-get install`, `npm install`/`npm ci`, `pip install`) is *also* committed
# as a vendored copy under a dependency-manager directory (node_modules/,
# vendor/, .venv/) in the same tree. That is exactly what happened in #1449:
# dev-lead committed node_modules/bats/ while lint.yml already ran
# `apt-get install -y bats`, so CI installed bats twice from two sources and the
# committed copy was pure noise.
#
# Deliberately narrow (#1468 Dev Notes, AC #2):
#   - Static allowlist of (tool leaf -> install-step regex) tuples. NOT a general
#     dependency resolver — a tool is only checked if it is in the allowlist AND
#     an actual workflow install step names it.
#   - Fires ONLY on the overlap: CI installs tool X *and* a vendored copy of X is
#     present under a dependency-manager directory. A legitimate first-party
#     committed asset (not under node_modules/vendor/.venv, or of a tool CI does
#     not install) never trips it.
#   - Scans git-tracked files when the tree is a git work tree, so a gitignored
#     local `npm install` (per .gitignore, bats lives under node_modules/ at dev
#     time) never fires — only a COMMITTED vendored copy does, matching the
#     #1449 signature. Non-git trees (test fixtures) fall back to a filesystem
#     scan.
#
# Usage: check-vendored-installed-tools.sh [tree]   (default: the repo root that
#        contains this scripts/ directory)
