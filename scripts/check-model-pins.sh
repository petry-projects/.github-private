# scripts/check-model-pins.sh (#1979) — fail when a concrete Claude model id is
# hard-pinned outside the allowed files.
#
# The org standard: name a model FAMILY (opus|sonnet|haiku) and let
# ai_model_for_family (scripts/lib/engine-models.sh) return the current id, so a
# model swap is one variable/chain edit rather than a hunt across the tree
# (companion petry-projects/.github#1199).
#
# A "pin" is any concrete, digit-versioned Claude id — claude-<family>-<digit>…
# (opus|sonnet|haiku|fable) — appearing under a scanned directory. Two escape
# hatches keep legitimate concrete ids from failing the check:
#   1. Allow-listed files (the resolver that defines the mapping; the price table
#      that must name ids for historical token records).
#   2. Any line carrying the marker `model-pin-ok:` (a per-line, reasoned
#      exception — e.g. the eval judge held fixed for confound control).
#
# Usage: check-model-pins.sh [root]   (root defaults to the repo root)
# Exit:  0 clean · 1 one or more unmarked pins (each printed as file:line)
#        2 a scan error (grep failed), so the tree cannot be certified clean

ROOT="${1:-$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)}"

# docs/ is deliberately NOT scanned: docs legitimately cite concrete ids (pricing
# history, override examples, migration notes). Describe a workflow's model by
# its family there; this gate covers the code and config that actually run.
SCAN_DIRS=(.github scripts prompts agents personas)
# Family-first ids (claude-<family>-<N>…) and the legacy version-first form
# (claude-<N>-<N>-<family>-<date>).

# ids: the resolver defines the family→id mapping, the price table records rates,
