# template_stub_drift.sh — drift guard for the repo-template scaffold (#969, epic
# #964). Fails CI when a file committed in petry-projects/repo-template has
# drifted from its canonical standards-derived baseline, so the template stays a
# thin distribution layer of standards/ and never becomes a competing fork.
#
# repo-template is a DISTRIBUTION ARTIFACT of the canonical standards/ in the
# public petry-projects/.github repo: scripts/seed-repo-template.sh fetches each
# canonical workflow stub / baseline file and ships it (caller stubs repinned to
# the published @<name>/v<MAJOR>-stable channel, inline stubs + baseline files verbatim).
# This guard re-derives that standards-based content and compares it, file by
# file, against what is actually committed in the template repo.
#
# It REUSES the byte-identity drift model from fleet_stub_drift.sh:
#   classify_stub_drift <expected_sha> <committed_sha> -> ALIGNED|DRIFTED|MISSING
#   stub_drift_row <file> <expected_sha> <committed_sha>
# The "expected" SHA is the git blob SHA of seed-repo-template.sh's emission for
# the file (the standards-derived content, repin included); the "committed" SHA
# is the blob SHA the contents API returns for the file in the template repo.
# Equal blob SHAs ⇒ byte-identical files ⇒ the template still tracks standards.
#
# All functions here are PURE (no network): they take SHAs / a drift TSV and
# write to stdout, exactly like fleet_stub_drift.sh. The network (gh contents
# reads + git hash-object of the seed emission) lives only in the CLI driver
# (main) at the bottom, mirroring how fleet_monitor.sh drives fleet_stub_drift.sh.
#
# Drift TSV format (5 fields, tab-separated); the first 4 are shared with
# fleet_stub_drift.sh, the 5th records which published version the committed file
# matched under #1448's N / N-1 acceptance:
#   1:file  2:status  3:committed_sha  4:expected_sha(N)  5:matched(N|N-1|"")
# A file is ALIGNED if it matches the emission at the current published version (N)
# or the immediately-preceding one (N-1); an N-1 match is a visible propagation
# notice, not silent (#1448 AC #8). The resolved standards ref + commit SHA the
# baseline is derived at is recorded in the report header (AC #7), and a guard
# asserts neither N nor N-1 carries a pre-#1184 legacy non-major-scoped pin (AC #9).
