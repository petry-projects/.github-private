# verify-persona-identity.sh — LIVE-ish drift check for persona runtime identity.
#
# The schema (persona.schema.json) validates the SHAPE of runtime.identity and
# validate-personas.py makes it MANDATORY. This script closes the loop between the
# manifest and the workflows that consume it, so the declared identity and the
# actual CI wiring can never silently diverge (the failure mode behind
# .github-private#1316). For each persona it asserts:
#
#   1. credential naming — a non-grandfathered credential MUST be
#      GH_PAT_<ACCOUNT_UPPER_SNAKE>[_<QUALIFIER>] for the declared account.
#   2. credential is real — the secret is referenced by at least one workflow
#      (guards against declaring a phantom/typo'd secret).
#   3. runtime consumption — a persona that ships a write workflow MUST resolve
#      its identity from the manifest (call resolve-persona-identity.sh), not from
#      the shared vars.BOT_USER.
#
# Usage: verify-persona-identity.sh [personas-root]
# Exit 0 = all good; exit 1 = a drift/violation was found.
