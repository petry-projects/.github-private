# Reads CODEOWNERS from .github/CODEOWNERS, CODEOWNERS, or docs/CODEOWNERS in
# the PR's repo. Extracts every @user / @org/team mention (path-pattern rules
# are not parsed — for an escalation we want every owner notified, not just
# the ones whose patterns match the diff). Requests review from each entry.
#
# Best-effort: every individual request-review call is tolerated to fail. The
# whole script also exits 0 unconditionally so the caller can chain it with
# other escalation steps.
