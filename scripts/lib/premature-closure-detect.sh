#
# #1077: the dev-lead agent closed tracking issues as `completed` without the fix
# actually landing on `main` — the issue closed, but the problem it described was
# still present, with NO merged PR that resolved it. The mechanical families were
# genuinely fixed; the harder families were closed on task-attempt rather than on
# a merged, verifying change. The org SonarCloud open-finding count was unchanged
# even after all the tracking issues closed as `state_reason = completed`.
#
# This is a set of PURE functions: given an issue's already-gathered close
# metadata, decide whether it is a premature-closure CANDIDATE. It never mutates
# an issue — surfacing/routing (report, re-open, re-label) is the caller's job
# (scripts/premature-closure-audit.sh).
#
#   premature_closure_reasons <state_reason> <minutes_open> <has_merged_closing_pr>
#     Prints one human-readable reason line when the issue is a candidate;
#     nothing otherwise. This is the unit under test.
#   is_premature_closure <state_reason> <minutes_open> <has_merged_closing_pr>
#     Exit 0 when a candidate, 1 otherwise.
#   minutes_between <iso_from> <iso_to>
#     Whole minutes between two ISO-8601 timestamps (clamped at 0, deterministic).
#   generate_premature_closure_report <candidates_tsv_file>
#     Renders the markdown report section from a candidates TSV.
#
# A candidate is the CONJUNCTION of three conditions (recommended action #3),
# chosen so a normal human close does NOT false-positive:
#   1. state_reason == completed        (closed as "done", not "not planned")
#   2. NO merged closing PR              (nothing actually landed the fix)
#   3. closed within N minutes of open   (the fast task-attempt tell)
# The window N is a SOFT, env-overridable threshold (strict <, matching the
# "within N minutes of open" wording).

# to count as the fast dev-lead task-attempt close. Env-overridable.
