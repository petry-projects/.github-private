# hold-notice.sh — PURE logic for the dev-lead "held item" notice (#1767).
#
# When dev-lead skips a work item because of a hold label (see
# scripts/lib/hold-gate.sh + dev-lead-intent.sh emit_hold_skip), the skip is only
# visible in a workflow-run log nobody reads — so the agent looks stalled
# (indistinguishable from the #1741 cancellation and #1592 silent-no-op defects).
# PR #1742 sat four days with 15 unresolved threads and no visible dev-lead
# activity while it was in fact behaving correctly: deliberately withholding
# action on a `needs-human-review` hold. This library builds the one-time comment
# that makes the withhold visible, and decides idempotently whether to post it.
#
# These functions are PURE (no network, no LLM, no global state) so they are
# unit-tested offline per ADR-0004; scripts/dev-lead-hold-notice.sh is the thin
# I/O wrapper that lists comments, calls these, and posts/edits via `gh`.
#
# Idempotency + re-arm model (AC2/AC4/AC6):
#   * A live notice carries the ACTIVE marker `<!-- dev-lead-hold-notice
#     label=<label> -->`. hold_notice_should_post refuses to re-post while that
#     exact marker is present → exactly one comment per hold, not one per skip.
#   * Collapsing (on re-arm/pickup) rewrites the comment: it drops the ACTIVE
#     marker and stamps the SUPERSEDED marker `<!-- dev-lead-hold-notice
#     superseded label=<label> -->`. Because the superseded marker does NOT
#     contain the active marker as a substring, a collapsed notice no longer
#     suppresses a fresh notice — so if the item is held again later, a new
#     notice is posted. The collapse itself is idempotent.
#
# This file is meant to be SOURCED, not executed.

# hold_notice_active_marker <label>
#   The idempotency marker stamped into a live hold notice. Substring-unique.
