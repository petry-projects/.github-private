# self-dismissed-approval.sh — has pr-review's own gate dismissed its approval at
# the current head, leaving the PR "pending re-evaluation" rather than reviewed?
# (#1933)
#
# The maintainer-comment gate (#1813) and the maintainer-review-thread gate
# (#1415) in review-one-pr.sh dismiss pr-review's APPROVED review at the head
# when they block. Once the blocking comment/thread is dealt with on the SAME
# head, the next run passes every gate and then reaches the same-SHA idempotency
# check, which sees the approval marker and no-ops with `already-reviewed-at-head`
# — so the PR stays unapproved until a new commit or a human @mention (#1933,
# the #1551 shape). A gate dismissal means "re-evaluate when the gate clears",
# not "reviewed"; this library recognises exactly that state so the caller can
# re-run the FULL cascade (every gate armed — never a re-posted approval).
#
# Deliberately narrow. Pending re-evaluation only when ALL hold:
#   • the NEWEST review by the pr-review identity at <head> that carries the
#     approval marker for <head> is now DISMISSED;
#   • its latest `review_dismissed` event was made by automation (a `[bot]` App,
#     the pr-review identity, or an AUTOMATION_BOT_LOGINS account) with one of
#     the gate-dismissal messages below;
#   • no review by the pr-review identity at <head> is currently APPROVED.
# A human's dismissal, the #1596 "accepted defect — re-review required"
# dismissal, a supersede dismissal, or anything unreadable is NOT pending
# re-evaluation (fail closed: the same-SHA no-op stands).
#
# This file is meant to be SOURCED, not executed.

# The messages review-one-pr.sh's gates stamp on their dismissals (prefix match).
# Keep in sync with the `dismissPullRequestReview` calls there; a test asserts it.
