# pr-review-sweep-metrics.sh — pure helpers for the pr-review sweep-hit-rate
# metric surfaced on the daily health report (#1408, epic #1402).
#
# The pr-review-sweep scheduled (cron) path is the guaranteed backstop for
# genuinely UN-eventable cases — GitHub-App / cross-repo checks like SonarCloud
# that emit no workflow_run — while the workflow_run fast path handles every
# eventable case near-instantly. The sweep-hit-rate makes "how often does the
# timer actually have to act?" a TRACKED number:
#
#   sweep-hit-rate = scheduled ticks that re-dispatched a review
#                    ÷ total scheduled ticks
#
# Because the scheduled path now fires only for the un-eventable residue, every
# scheduled re-dispatch is by construction a case the event fast path did not
# cover. Interpretation (AC #3): a LOW rate confirms the timer stays
# exception-only; a RISING rate signals an eventable case is leaking onto the
# timer (a hole in the narrowing) and should be investigated.
#
# These functions are PURE: they take telemetry / log text on argv and write to
# stdout. No network, no side effects. Unit-tested in
# tests/pr_review_sweep_metrics.bats. Live gh-API I/O lives in
# scripts/pr_review_health.sh, which sources this.

# pr_review_sweep_hit_rate <sweep_runs_json>
#   Input : JSON array of sweep run objects, each carrying
#             {event, dispatched}
#           where `event` is the triggering event (".event" from the runs API)
#           and `dispatched` is the count of reviews that run re-dispatched
#           (absent/null → treated as 0). Only scheduled ticks (event ==
#           "schedule") are counted — workflow_run fast-path runs are excluded.
#   Output: a single TSV line: ticks<TAB>hits<TAB>rate
#             ticks — number of scheduled sweep ticks in the window
#             hits  — scheduled ticks that re-dispatched ≥1 review
#             rate  — "N%" (integer hits*100/ticks) or "n/a" when ticks == 0
#           Absent/empty JSON → "0\t0\tn/a".
