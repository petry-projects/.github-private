# Advisory Bot Review Gate
#
# Instant check (non-blocking) for advisory bot reviews.
# Instead of polling for 60 minutes, this script checks the current state
# of bot reviews and returns immediately. The pr-review workflow will be
# re-triggered when bots submit their reviews (pull_request_review event).
#
# This design avoids GitHub Actions billing for long-running workflow blocks.
# Cost: $0.008/min × 1-2 min checks vs. $0.008/min × 60 min blocks
#
# This gate ensures valid code reviews are incorporated before approval, addressing:
# - Issue #457: Advisory bots finishing after pr-review approval
# - PR #453 incident: Copilot review arriving 43 seconds too late
#
# Usage:
#   check_advisory_reviews "$PR_URL"
#
# Returns:
#   0 = All detected advisory bots have submitted (ready to approve)
#   1 = Waiting for bots (defer approval, will re-check on next bot review)
#
# Environment:
#   GH_TOKEN (set by calling workflow)
#   PR_URL (passed as argument)
