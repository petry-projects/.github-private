# pr-review-miss-rate.sh — DETERMINISTIC false-negative metric for pr-review (#1596).
#
# We already measure pr-review's operational health (pr_review_health.sh) and its
# false POSITIVES (evals/deep-review). This library adds the one signal that was
# free and perfectly labelled but evaporating: a trusted third-party advisory bot
# found a real defect on a PR pr-review had already APPROVED. That is a false
# NEGATIVE — a miss.
#
# No LLM is involved here (matching reviewer_report.sh's stated design): every
# figure is computed with jq from GitHub review data. The functions are PURE —
# they read JSON and write JSON/Markdown, doing no network I/O — so they are
# unit-tested in tests/test_pr_review_miss_rate.bats. The collection wrapper lives
# in scripts/reviewer_report.sh, which already fetches each PR's reviews, review
# threads (with resolution state) and comments in one GraphQL round-trip per repo.
#
# ── The metric ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   missed_findings   — threads a trusted advisory bot opened AFTER pr-review's
#                       approving review, that were resolved as ACCEPTED (a fix
#                       landed / the disposition accepted it) rather than refuted.
#   caught_findings   — findings pr-review raised itself that were accepted.
#   partial_evidence_approvals
#                     — approvals issued via the advisory-gate timeout fallback,
#                       i.e. before all registered bots reported (recorded on the
#                       PR by scripts/lib/advisory-review-gate.sh as a marker).
#
# ── The crux: accepted vs refuted (documented rule) ──────────────────────────
# Roughly 3 of 4 advisory-bot findings are false positives correctly refuted, so a
# naive "a bot opened a thread → pr-review missed it" counter would be dominated by
# noise and would push the agent toward MORE false positives. We therefore classify
# each finding by the disposition recorded in its resolving reply and count ONLY
# accepted ones. The rule (pr_review_classify_disposition):
#   1. An explicit machine marker wins:  <!-- disposition: accepted|refuted -->
#      (last one on the thread takes effect).
#   2. Otherwise keyword heuristics over the NON-BOT reply comments:
#        - accepted signals: "good catch", "fixed", "addressed", "accepted", …
#        - refuted signals:  "false positive", "not applicable", "by design", …
#   3. If neither (or both) fire → AMBIGUOUS.
# A finding counts as a miss ONLY when the disposition is "accepted" AND the thread
# is resolved. Anything AMBIGUOUS counts as NOT a miss — we deliberately under-count
# rather than manufacture misses from noise.

# ── Defaults ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Trusted advisory bots whose accepted findings count. Kept as a JSON array string
# so the pure functions need no external registry; reviewer_report.sh passes its
# own REVIEWER_BOTS list in, which is the advisory-review-gate single source.
