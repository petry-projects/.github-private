# holdout-guard.sh — held-out eval immutability guard (#692, epic #581).
#
# This is the *hard* CI enforcement that backs the advisory CODEOWNERS rule over
# evals/. CODEOWNERS only routes review (and only blocks merges when branch
# protection's "require review from code owners" is enabled — an unstated
# dependency). This guard is the immutability guarantee: it fails any PR whose
# author is the automated skill-proposer identity when that PR changes a
# held-out path, keyed purely on PR author + changed paths.
#
# It complements, does not replace, CODEOWNERS:
#   - CODEOWNERS routes review.
#   - this guard is the immutability guarantee — independent of whether
#     CODEOWNER review is enforced.
#
# Decision (hg_evaluate):
#   author NOT a proposer identity           -> PASS (humans/CODEOWNERS edit evals/)
#   author IS a proposer + no guarded path   -> PASS (e.g. prompts/triage.md)
#   author IS a proposer + a guarded path    -> FAIL (the held-out guarantee)
#
# Proposer identity (HOLDOUT_PROPOSER_IDENTITIES, default "github-actions[bot]"):
#   The proposer runs as GITHUB_TOKEN (see evals/README.md), whose PR author
#   login is github-actions[bot]. This is intentionally DISTINCT from the
#   dev-lead bot (donpetry-bot), which authors the eval *stories* (like #692
#   itself) and must keep passing. Override via repo variable when the Phase-3
#   proposer (#587) lands with its own bot account.
#
# Guarded prefixes (HOLDOUT_GUARDED_PREFIXES, default "evals/"):
#   Path prefixes (each should end with "/") that are held-out. The holdout
#   split lives under evals/<skill>/holdout/, so the evals/ prefix already
#   covers it; add a second prefix here if a holdout is ever separately rooted.
