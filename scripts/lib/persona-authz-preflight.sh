# shellcheck shell=bash
# scripts/lib/persona-authz-preflight.sh — persona authorization-preflight
# DECISION layer (#1776, split from #1734 AC #5).
#
# The gap this closes: a persona's declared posting credential can AUTHENTICATE
# correctly and still lack authorization to WRITE. Every prior check verifies
# authentication and naming (resolve-persona-identity.sh, verify-persona-identity.sh,
# the runner's wrong-identity guard); none verified authorization. That let a
# valid-but-unauthorized token reach `gh api .../comments` and return 403 only
# AFTER the paid engine call — the advisory was produced and then discarded
# (#1734, run 34183239687), and a pr-review approval silently never landed on
# PR #1788 while the surrounding code treated it as success.
#
# These are PURE functions: given the already-gathered facts of a non-destructive
# capability probe (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` reading `.permissions` for the
# authenticated identity), decide one of three outcomes. They NEVER touch the
# network or write content — the gh probe and the ::error::/::warning:: side
# effects are the wrapper's job (scripts/persona-authz-preflight.sh).
#
# The three states are deliberately distinct (AC #1, #4):
#   AUTHORIZED    — the permission surface is readable AND a write bit is set:
#                   proceed silently.
#   UNAUTHORIZED  — the permission surface is readable AND no write bit is set:
#                   a DEFINITE negative. Fail loudly; the diagnostic names the
#                   account, the credential secret, and the missing capability.
#   INDETERMINATE — the surface could not be read (5xx, rate limit, 401, network,
#                   or absent `.permissions`): WARN and proceed. Fail OPEN — a
#                   transient blip must never be reported as "cannot write" nor
#                   gate a legitimate advisory (AC #4). This is the delicate rule:
#                   a preflight that blocks advisories on a hiccup is worse than
#                   the bug it prevents.
#
# A missing/invalid secret is NOT this layer's concern: it is handled earlier
# (the wrapper skips the probe when no PAT is present; the post step already fails
# closed on it). This layer answers only "authenticated — can it write?".
#
# Detection scope — what the `.permissions` proxy can and cannot detect (AC #2):
#   CAN:    a credential whose account has NO repository write (push/maintain/admin
#           are all false on a readable surface) — the #1734 / PR #1788 class, where
#           write access to a private org repo is exactly what commenting requires.
#           This is the authenticated-but-unauthorized break the issue targets.
#   CANNOT: finer-grained gaps below the repo-write bit (e.g. a fine-grained PAT
#           granted "Issues: read" but not "Issues: write", or org/branch
#           restrictions) — those do not always surface in `.permissions`. Such a
#           result reads as INDETERMINATE (unknown/unreadable) and fails OPEN, never
#           as a false negative. The probe is deliberately conservative: it only
#           gates on an unambiguous "no write" and treats everything else as
#           proceed. It is a cheap, non-destructive early warning, not a proof of
#           comment-write; the post step's own failure handling (#1775) remains the
#           backstop for anything the proxy cannot see.

# authz_write_capability <admin> <maintain> <push> [triage]
#   Map the comment-implying booleans from a repo's `.permissions` object to a
#   capability signal. Each argument is the string GitHub returns ("true"/"false")
#   or empty when the object was absent/unreadable.
#     yes     — at least one of admin/maintain/push/triage is "true". triage is
#               included because the triage role grants issue/PR comment access —
#               exactly what posting the advisory needs — so a triage-only identity
#               must not be rejected as a false negative (it can produce and post
#               its advisory).
#     no      — the object was present (>=1 arg non-empty) and no such bit is set
#     unknown — every argument is empty (no `.permissions` object to read)
#   Only a literal "true" counts as a capability; any other value is not-write, so
#   a garbled field can never be mistaken for a grant.
