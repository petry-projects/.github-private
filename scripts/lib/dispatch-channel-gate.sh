#!/usr/bin/env bash
# dispatch-channel-gate.sh — hold a retry payload back from a target repo whose
# pinned dev-lead harness does not read every field in it (#2086).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   dev-lead-retry.yml runs scripts/ at ONE release: the channel this repo's
#   dev-lead.yml pins via `agent_ref` (#2050). The sweep then sends
#   repository_dispatch events to every repo in the org, and each target parses
#   them with scripts/dev-lead-intent.sh at ITS OWN dev-lead.yml pin (the stub
#   contract allows a per-repo ring/channel pin). A target pinned older than the
#   sweep can be sent a client_payload field its parser drops — the #2017 / #2050
#   skew again, across repos instead of across time.
#
# WHAT THIS LIBRARY DECIDES
#   Per payload, not per repo: most retry payloads carry only fields every
#   release reads, so a target on an older channel (the fleet sits on stable)
#   keeps its retries; only a payload with a field the target's parser lacks is
#   held back. For each target:
#     pin       its dev-lead.yml `agent_ref` (the reusable's default, main, when
#               the stub passes none) — the ref its harness checks scripts/ out at
#     fields    the `.client_payload.<key>` reads in dev-lead-intent.sh and the
#               lib/*.sh files it names, at that pin (comments stripped; the
#               same reading scripts/check-retry-payload-fields.sh does in CI)
#   A payload goes out only when the target's parser reads all its fields
#   (INFORMATIONAL ones aside). Pin == the sweep's channel needs no lookup: the
#   sweep and that parser ship together, and CI checks them against each other.
#     no dev-lead.yml            nothing in that repo receives it → hold, no warning
#     pin or parser unreadable   compatibility unproven → hold, warn (fail closed)
#     a field not read           hold, warn once per repo and field set
#   A held payload leaves its markers in place, so the retry resumes once the
#   target is repinned to a channel that reads the field.
#
# The gate is OFF (every payload allowed, no API reads) until dcg_init runs with
# SWEEP_AGENT_REF set — dev-lead-retry.yml passes its resolved channel. Unit
# tests and scripts/check-retry-payload-fields.sh source the sweep without it.
#
# Env:
