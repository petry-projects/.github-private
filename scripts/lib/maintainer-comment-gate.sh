# Maintainer issue-comment gate (issues #1290, #1813)
#
# A maintainer finding posted as a PR *issue comment* — what `gh pr comment` and
# the GitHub main comment box produce — creates NO review thread. So unlike an
# inline review comment it:
#   1. does not trip `required_review_thread_resolution` → does not block merge, and
#   2. is never enumerated by dev-lead's fix-reviews prompt (it walks reviewThreads),
# and pr-review approves → the PR auto-merges with the defect intact. The same
# words, posted two ways, have opposite force; the easy path (`gh pr comment`) is
# the silent one.
#
# This gate closes the "does not block" half at the pr-review approval boundary.
#
# #1813 REDESIGN — "addressed" means a VERIFIED DISPOSITION, not a timestamp.
#   The original gate (#1290) judged a comment addressed by comparing timestamps:
#   a push at/after the comment cleared it. That was wrong twice over:
#     • it depended on the head-push timestamp, which GitHub now always returns
#       as null, so the gate failed closed on every open PR (the #1813 outage); and
#     • a push is only a proxy — it says nothing about whether a comment's finding
#       was read, checked, and acted on.
#   The redesign removes the push-timestamp model entirely. dev-lead
#   researches each undispositioned comment and posts exactly one evidence-backed
#   reply carrying `<!-- dev-lead:comment-disposition id=<id> disposition=<...> -->`;
#   the harness verifies that disposition and then minimizes the ORIGINAL comment
#   with classifier RESOLVED (GraphQL minimizeComment). This gate treats a
#   RESOLVED-minimized comment as addressed and withholds approval while ANY
#   non-agent issue comment lacks that signal.
#
#   Scope: every PR issue comment, from human maintainers and bots alike
#   (codeant-ai, qodo-code-review, and so on), EXCEPT the exemption set recorded
#   in ADR-0012 (#2209), which narrows #1813's "every PR issue comment":
#     • our bot login;
#     • a body carrying one of our registered automation markers — our own
#       disposition/ack/note replies (so the agent never has to answer itself)
#       and the `<!-- auto-rebase-conflict: ... -->` sentinel (the conflict
#       already blocks the merge, so counting the comment gates it twice);
#     • from an OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR only: a review request, matched on the
#       whole trimmed body (`@<bot user>`, optionally `please review` with an
#       optional `.`/`!`, optionally the Claude Code footer) and nothing looser;
#     • from an OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR only: the explicit opt-out marker
#       `<!-- maintainer:not-a-finding -->`;
#     • a registered clean info-status bot comment (#1918).
#   No author is exempt by login alone: don-petry is also the account dev-lead and
#   the personas post from (ADR-0008). A steering comment stays in scope unless
#   the maintainer opts it out. The definition is _MAINTAINER_GATE_SCOPE_JQ_DEFS,
#   shared with dev-lead's candidate filter (maintainer_gate_open_comment_ids).
#
# It FAILS CLOSED: an inability to evaluate the snapshot must block, and is
# reported DISTINCTLY (return 2 → a distinct verdict reason) so an undeterminable
# gate state can never recur disguised as a legitimate hold (#1813 AC8).
#
# check_maintainer_comments <pr_snapshot_json> [bot_user]
#   <pr_snapshot_json> — output of `gh pr view --json comments,...`; each comment
#                        must carry {author.login, authorAssociation, body,
#                        isMinimized, minimizedReason}.
#   [bot_user]         — the agent's own login (default donpetry-bot)
# Returns:
#   0 = every non-agent issue comment is minimized RESOLVED (or none exist)
#   1 = at least one non-agent issue comment lacks a verified disposition → block
#   2 = the snapshot could not be evaluated (malformed) → fail closed → block
#
# The check is pure: it makes no `gh`/network calls and reuses the snapshot the
# caller already fetched, so it adds no API round-trip and is trivially testable.
# maintainer_gate_head_committer_date() is a thin `gh` helper retained for the
# sibling review-thread gate's push-time needs; it uses committer.date and reads
# NO push-timestamp field (#1813 AC1 / matching advisory-review-gate.sh, #577).

# Regex (case-sensitive) matching the HTML markers our own automation stamps into
# comment bodies — pr-review reviews/acks (`<!-- pr-review-agent ... -->`,

# This marker-based exclusion is essential because these workflows post as the

# the loop-safety guard (#860 / #1813 AC7): our own disposition reply carries the
# `dev-lead` marker, so it is never itself counted as a comment needing a response.
# `maintainer-resolve` is the marker on the reply maintainer-resolve-comment.sh
# posts when it dispositions a registered reviewer bot's comment (#1918) — that
# reply must not itself become a fresh undispositioned blocker.
# `auto-rebase-conflict:` is the auto-rebase sentinel (#2209). A conflict already
# blocks the merge, so the comment reporting it is not a second blocker.

  #         must cover the current body;

  #         Dispositioning only a notice never clears findings;
