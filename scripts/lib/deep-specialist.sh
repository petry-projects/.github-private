# deep-specialist.sh — issue-type classifier routing for the deep review tier
# (issue #1091, epic #1088).
#
# The Tier-1 triage prompt (prompts/triage.md) now emits a `type` label that
# classifies an escalated diff into one of {security, logic, performance,
# style}. This helper turns that label into the specialist deep-review prompt
# the cascade should load for the deep tier — resolved DATA-DRIVEN through the
# rubric registry (scripts/lib/review-registry.tsv `deep_specialist:<type>`
# rows), NOT a switch statement in review-one-pr.sh. That keeps specialist
# routing consistent with the artifact-contract standard: add a manifest row,
# do not fork the reviewer.
#
# The classifier rides on the existing Haiku-tier triage call — there is no new
# model tier and no extra call, so median review cost is unchanged.
#
# Fallback (AC #4): when the label is absent/ambiguous, has no registry row, or
# points at a specialist prompt that is not on disk, resolution falls back to
# the monolithic prompts/deep-review.md so the deep tier never dead-ends.
#
# Usage: source this file, then call:
#   normalize_diff_type <raw-label>     -> canonical class or "ambiguous"
#   classify_triage_type <triage-json>  -> canonical class or "ambiguous"
#   resolve_deep_specialist <type> <fallback-prompt>
#       -> specialist prompt path, or <fallback-prompt> if unresolved

# and takes the monolithic fallback path.

#   file exists on disk; otherwise prints <fallback-prompt>. Never fails — the
#   fallback guarantees a usable prompt (AC #4).
#
#   The repo root used to confirm the specialist file exists is derived from
#   this file's location; override with DEEP_SPECIALIST_REPO_ROOT in tests.
