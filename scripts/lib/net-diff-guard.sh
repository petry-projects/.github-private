# net-diff-guard.sh — shared "net diff against base" helpers (#1786, slice 1 of
# epic #1620).
#
# dev-lead must never open a PR, claim completion, or push a self-cancelling
# update whose NET diff against the base branch is empty. The net diff is the
# three-dot compare `origin/<base>...HEAD` — the changes the branch's own commits
# introduce relative to their merge-base with the base — NOT the PR's file list
# (a file touched and then reverted still appears in the file list but nets to
# zero). Merging a `Closes #N` PR that nets to zero would auto-close its
# compliance issue while the finding stays unfixed, and the idempotent audit
# would immediately re-open it (the #1340 failure mode, generalised here to the
# PR-open and completion-claim paths as well as every push).
#
# Two entry points:
#   net_diff_is_empty <base>  — true (rc 0) iff the three-dot net diff is empty.
#   net_diff_summary  <base>  — echo a human-readable "N file(s), +A/-D lines".
#
# FAIL-OPEN contract: when the base ref cannot be resolved to a concrete commit
# (no ref, fetch fails, shallow clone with no common ancestor, diff errors),
# net_diff_is_empty returns 1 ("not net-zero") and warns, so an UNVERIFIABLE
# state never blocks a legitimate push/PR. Resolution requires a NON-EMPTY base
# SHA — an empty rev-parse result is treated as unresolved, not as "base is the
# empty tree" — which is what keeps PATH-stubbed unit tests (whose git stub
# echoes nothing for unknown args) failing open instead of falsely aborting.

# _ndg_resolve_base_sha <base> — echo the concrete commit SHA for origin/<base>,
# deepening a shallow clone and fetching the ref if needed. Echoes nothing (and
# the caller fails open) when it cannot be resolved.
