#
# #1587: dev-lead failed 100% of runs across 8 repos for seven days — every run
# died at the "Engine token preflight" step with
# "CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN is not provided to dev-lead-reusable." — and NOTHING
# escalated to a human. Two gaps let a total engine outage run silently:
#   1. a sustained fleet-wide preflight failure only accumulated in periodic
#      health reports instead of escalating differently from a flaky check;
#   2. pr-review had no preflight, so a tokenless run failed OPEN (exit success
#      having reviewed nothing) and its green conclusion was cited as "healthy".
#
# This is a set of PURE functions: given already-gathered run/step metadata,
# decide — per repo — whether the engine-token preflight is failing, and whether
# the aggregate warrants a FLEET-level alert (the outage class this monitor
# exists to catch) vs. ISOLATED single-repo health-check reporting vs. NONE. It
# also classifies a credential's scope/expiry (GH_PAT_DON_PETRY, a classic PAT
# whose silent rotation surfaces only as an opaque 401/403 on the next run). It
# NEVER touches the network or mutates anything — the gh/jq gathering and the
# alert/report side-effects are the caller's job (scripts/engine_liveness.sh).
#
# Escalation contract (issue scope 3), all keyed on the preflight step outcome:
#   AGENTS_PAUSED=true                               -> silent, no alert (caller)
#   >=2 consecutive preflight failures in >=2 repos  -> FLEET alert
#   otherwise any single-repo preflight failure      -> ISOLATED (routine report)

# The verbatim step name both dev-lead-reusable.yml and pr-review.yml carry. A
# run that fails HERE is the outage signature; a run that fails at a LATER step
# is a different problem this monitor does not own.
