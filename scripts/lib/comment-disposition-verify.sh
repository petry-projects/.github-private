# comment-disposition-verify.sh — the pure verifier for the dev-lead PR
# issue-comment DISPOSITION marker (#1813).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   maintainer-comment-gate.sh (#1290) judged an issue comment "addressed" by
#   comparing timestamps: a push after the comment cleared it. That is a proxy —
#   it says nothing about whether the comment's finding was read, checked, and
#   acted on, and it depended on pushedDate (now always null), so the gate failed
#   closed on every open PR (#1813). The redesign makes "addressed" mean a
#   VERIFIED DISPOSITION: dev-lead researches each comment and posts exactly one
#   evidence-backed reply carrying
#
#     <!-- dev-lead:comment-disposition id=<comment_id> disposition=<fixed|invalid|
#          out-of-scope|answered|informational> [sha=<40-hex>] [ref=#<n>] -->
#
#   and the harness verifies that disposition and then minimizes the ORIGINAL
#   comment with classifier RESOLVED (GraphQL minimizeComment). The pr-review gate
#   then treats a RESOLVED-minimized comment as addressed. This library is the
#   issue-comment sibling of addressed-claim-verify.sh (the review-thread path).
#
# PURITY / TESTABILITY
#   Every cdv_* function here is PURE: no gh/git/network. Verification of a claim
#   against the pushed diff (the `fixed` case) reuses acv_gather_commit_facts from
#   addressed-claim-verify.sh in the caller; this library only decides, from the
#   parsed disposition and a caller-supplied `verified` boolean, whether the
#   harness may resolve the comment. Sourced under `set -euo pipefail`, so the
#   helpers only `return`, never `exit`, and fail closed on every ambiguity.

# ── `fixed` verification by diff content (#2004) ──────────────────────────────
# On PR #1977 a `fixed` disposition cited 89f46597, the commit that INTRODUCED the
# finding (its diff added `--emit-workflow-only`), not e7e7008b, the commit that
# removed it. The old rule ("the cited sha was produced by THIS pass") could never
# accept the real fix from an earlier pass, so the comment stayed open forever.
# Accepting any later commit instead would fail OPEN: an unrelated commit would
# resolve the comment. So the cited commit's own diff must REMOVE (a `-` line) a
# distinctive token named by the finding and must not ADD it (a `+` line). Only a
# finding with no extractable token falls back to the date rule, and the verdict
# names that weaker basis (`date-only`).

# The jq program behind cdv_finding_tokens. HTML comments and fenced code blocks
# are dropped first: a fenced block is usually a suggested patch, whose text the
# fixing commit ADDS. Then it collects backticked spans, `--flag` names, and
# double- or single-quoted identifiers. A single quote counts only when it is not
# inside a word, so prose apostrophes ("it's") never open a span. The "p" flag
# lets `.` cross newlines, so a multi-line comment or fence is removed whole.

# cdv_select_disposition <cid> <bot_user> <comments_json>
#   Duplicate recovery / idempotency (#1992). The pre-#1992 resolver required
#   EXACTLY ONE authorized disposition per comment and failed closed on more, so
#   a comment that was dispositioned but not minimized in the same pass could
#   never converge: each later pass posted a second disposition, the resolver
#   then skipped the comment forever, and the maintainer gate deadlocked (#1952,
#   #1953). This picks ONE disposition deterministically so N authorized replies
#   collapse to one that the caller verifies + minimizes, while the rest are
#   reported as superseded for the caller to minimize OUTDATED.
#
#   Among the comments in <comments_json> (the PR's issue-comment nodes, each
#   {id, author{login,__typename}, body, isMinimized, minimizedReason, createdAt})
#   it keeps only replies that are ALL of:
#     - authored by <bot_user> (login == bot_user or its [bot]-stripped form) —
#       the authorization gate (CWE-863): a disposition from any other author
#       never counts and can never win, so an external commenter cannot smuggle a
#       marker citing a candidate id past the resolver;
#     - explicitly NOT minimized (isMinimized == false; a missing or unreadable
#       value fails closed, and a superseded reply we minimized on a prior pass
#       stops counting, so the count truly converges to one);
#     - carrying a well-formed ISO-8601 createdAt (an unreadable timestamp could
#       otherwise win the "latest" comparison, so it fails closed);
#     - parseable by cdv_parse_disposition AND citing id=<cid> (an unparseable or
#       mis-targeted marker is ignored — fail closed, never guessed).
#   Of those it selects the LATEST by createdAt, tie-broken by node id (lexical,
#   higher wins) so the choice is fully deterministic. Recommends the latest per
#   the issue, and the latest reflects dev-lead's most recent research.
