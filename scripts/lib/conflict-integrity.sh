# conflict-integrity.sh — post-conflict-resolution integrity check (#1482).
#
# A narrow, mechanical detector for the corruption class from #1449: a botched
# automated conflict resolution that duplicates whole blocks of a shell script
# (grew scripts/engine.sh from 2688 to 4011 lines, doubling run_writer /
# parse_reset_time / extract_verdict_json). Such a resolution "completes" and
# reports success, so nothing on the conflict-resolution path checks it — it only
# surfaces hours later when an unrelated test trips over the corrupted function.
#
# These helpers are pure (no network/git side effects) so they are unit-testable
# in isolation; the git/gh plumbing that feeds them lives in the caller
# (dev-lead-fix-reviews.sh's rebase intent). The detector is deliberately
# mechanical — duplicate top-level declarations — not a semantic "is this diff
# correct" analysis, which is neither tractable nor in scope.

# extract_top_level_symbols <file>
# Emit one line per top-level declaration in file order, tagged by kind:
#   fn:NAME   — a function declaration (`NAME() {` / `NAME()` / `function NAME`)
#   var:NAME  — a top-level variable assignment (optionally export/readonly/declare)
# "Top-level" means the declaration begins at column 0 (no leading whitespace),
# so nested functions and in-function `local` assignments are ignored. A symbol
# declared N times appears N times.
