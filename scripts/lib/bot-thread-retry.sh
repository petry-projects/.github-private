# bot-thread-retry.sh — retry a lost fix-reviews pass for unreplied trusted-bot
# review threads (#2046). The review-thread counterpart of bot-comment-retry.sh
# (#2017), which covers only PR issue comments.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   A trusted reviewer bot's review thread is processed only by a dev-lead
#   fix-reviews pass. When that pass is lost, nothing retried it. The pass can be
#   superseded in the per-PR concurrency lane, the event can route elsewhere, or
#   the pass can run without seeing the thread (the old single-page thread query,
#   see open-review-threads.sh). The thread then sits with no reply and no
#   resolution, and required_review_thread_resolution blocks the merge. On PR
#   #1953 eleven cubic and Codex threads had no reply at all.
#
# WHAT THIS LIBRARY DECIDES (btr_retry_decisions, PURE — no gh/network)
#   A CANDIDATE thread is unresolved, not outdated, and its originating comment is
#   by a `Bot` that is a trusted registered reviewer source. Outdated, resolved and
#   maintainer (User-originated) threads are never candidates. For each candidate:
#     replied                  some later comment in the thread is by our own
#                              automation (dev-lead/pr-review) — a fix, a deferral
#                              or a skip note all count; the thread was processed
#     thread-unreadable        the thread has more comments than were fetched, so
#                              a reply could be hidden; fail closed
#     retry-pending            a thread retry marker on this PR is younger than the
#                              pending window. The marker can name any thread: one
#                              fix-reviews pass sees every thread, and a second
#                              dispatch would supersede it in the per-PR lane
#     rate-limited             a fix-reviews pass on this PR ended rate-limited (or
#                              blocked) and its reset= time is still ahead
#     retry-attempts-exhausted the thread already had MAX retries since the last
#                              rate-limited end (an attempt that ran into the limit
#                              does not count), or MAX_TOTAL in all
#     grace-period             the thread is too new: the original event-driven run
#                              may still be pending or running
#     unreplied                otherwise → dispatch, as attempt <previous + 1>
#
#   Only markers and replies from our own automation count: the author's login
#   must be one of <automation_logins_csv>. A marker must also carry a trusted
#   association (OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR), as in bot-comment-retry.sh (CWE-863).
#
# SECURITY: nothing here (or in the sweep that uses it) replies to, resolves or
#   minimizes a thread. A retry only dispatches a fix-reviews pass, whose replies
#   and resolutions go through the harness's usual verification.
#
# Tunables (env), defaults mirror bot-comment-retry.sh:
#   BOT_THREAD_RETRY_MIN_AGE_SEC   grace for the original run (default 900 = 15 min)
#   BOT_THREAD_RETRY_PENDING_SEC   how long a dispatched retry is treated as still
#                                  pending/running (default 9000 = 150 min)
#   BOT_THREAD_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS  retries per thread since the last rate-limited
#                                  end (default 2)
#   BOT_THREAD_RETRY_MAX_TOTAL     hard ceiling on retries per thread, rate-limited
#                                  ones included (default 6)
