# Per-PR review-claim primitive (issue #1589, slice 1 — OBSERVE-ONLY).
#
# The #1551 metadata-digest re-arm path lets a same-SHA re-review proceed when a
# metadata-only fix-request's `meta=<digest>` no longer matches the current PR
# metadata. That path takes NO atomic claim before starting the cascade, so two
# triggers (a scheduled sweep + an event dispatch, or two dispatches) can read
# the same stale marker, both observe the digest mismatch, and BOTH launch the
# full cascade — a duplicate the #1551 fix newly made reachable.
#
# Slice 1 does NOT arbitrate that race (that is slice 2). It only makes the race
# OBSERVABLE by introducing:
#   • the claim KEY  = (head SHA, current metadata digest) — a metadata edit
#     re-arms the #1551 path and also changes the digest, so it yields a distinct
#     key; two runs racing at the same head+metadata share one key.
#   • the claim MARKER format:
#       <!-- pr-review-claim v1 sha=<SHA> meta=<DIGEST> run=<TOKEN> at=<TS> -->
#     posted as a PR comment before the cascade starts, carrying a per-run TOKEN
#     so a run can tell its own claim apart from a concurrent one.
#   • concurrent_claim_present — detects a live claim on the same key posted by a
#     DIFFERENT run, the telemetry signal the observe-only slice records.
#
# Slice 2 layers compare-and-set arbitration + a TTL (`at=` is the timestamp it
# will age against) on top of this exact format; slice 1 must not change caller
# behaviour, only surface the race.

# claim_key <sha> <digest>
#   Echo the stable claim key for a (head SHA, metadata digest) pair. The key
#   changes whenever either the SHA or the digest changes, and is stable when
#   neither does. Kept identical in shape to the marker's `sha=… meta=…` fields
#   so a parsed marker key (claim_marker_key) compares equal to it directly.

#   timestamp. Single-line so it round-trips as one PR-comment body.
