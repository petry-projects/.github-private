# Merged-PR few-shot injection helper for the PR-review cascade (issue #1093,
# epic #1088, Phase 2).
#
# Goal: give the deep-review (run_agentic deep) tier a few-shot file of past
# review->merge outcomes for THIS repo so it calibrates to what the maintainers
# actually accept and flag — improving precision cheaply. The examples are
# rendered into a bounded FEWSHOT block whose path is exported as FEWSHOT_FILE,
# mirroring the DOWNSTREAM_IMPACT_FILE / SYMBOL_CONTEXT_FILE optional-file
# contract the deep tier already reads (scripts/lib/downstream-impact.sh,
# scripts/lib/symbol-context.sh).
#
# Held-out discipline is non-negotiable (AC #2, evals/README.md). Few-shot
# examples must be sourced ONLY from a proposer-visible / dev split, NEVER from
# evals/**/holdout — the set the held-out gate later scores against. Showing the
# reviewer a held-out case would let the proposer overfit to the very cases the
# gate uses to decide "real improvement" ("teaching to the test").
# fewshot_source_is_holdout is the hard guard that mirrors the holdout-guard rule
# (scripts/lib/holdout-guard.sh); assemble_fewshot refuses a holdout source
# outright and injects nothing.
#
# De-identification is required (evals/README.md decision A3): every rendered
# example is scrubbed of secrets, tokens, internal hostnames, and PII before it
# can reach the prompt. This is defense-in-depth on top of the extractor
# de-identifying at commit time (scripts/evals/extract-fewshot.sh).
#
# Opt-in + inert by default (AC #3). The caller (review-one-pr.sh) only invokes
# assemble_fewshot when FEWSHOT_ENABLED=true. When it is off, FEWSHOT_FILE is
# never set, the deep prompt reads no few-shot block, and review behavior + cost
# are byte-identical to pre-feature. A missing/empty source degrades to the
# literal "(none)" — never fabricated, never fatal.

# AND contains a `holdout` directory segment (evals/<skill>/holdout/...). Return
# non-zero for any other path (a dev split, a prompt, an arbitrary file). Mirrors
# the holdout-guard prefix rule: the guarded root is evals/ and the holdout split
# lives under evals/<skill>/holdout/.

# De-identify (evals/README.md decision A3): replace secrets, tokens, internal

# text. Deliberately conservative — it over-redacts rather than risk leaking a
# real credential or PII into a proposer-visible / prompt-visible surface.
#
# Input: the text to scrub as $1, OR (when called with no argument) streamed on
# stdin so it can sit in a pipeline without spawning a per-item subshell.
#
# Order matters: token/hostname patterns run before the generic key=value and
# email patterns so a longer specific match is redacted whole. The IP rule uses
# POSIX ERE boundaries (captured and re-emitted) instead of the GNU-only `\b`, so
# the scrub behaves identically on BSD/macOS sed.
