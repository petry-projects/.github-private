# bot-comment-retry.sh — retry a lost fix-bot-comment pass for an undispositioned
# registered reviewer-bot PR issue comment (#2017).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   A registered bot's PR issue comment is dispositioned ONLY by dev-lead's
#   fix-bot-comment intent, and the maintainer-comment gate withholds approval
#   until it is (#1813). Every PR event shares one concurrency lane
#   (dev-lead-pr-<N>), and GitHub keeps at most ONE pending run per group: a burst
#   of bot comments right after a PR opens supersedes the pending fix-bot-comment
#   runs before they start (#2009: the CodeRabbit and CodeAnt runs were cancelled
#   with zero steps while the `opened` run held the lane). Nothing retried them, so
#   the PR sat green behind the gate until a human @mentioned dev-lead.
#
#   The comment still exists, so — unlike on-mention's USER_INSTRUCTION — its
#   context CAN be reconstructed: the retry pass re-fetches it by node id.
#
# WHAT THIS LIBRARY DECIDES (bcr_retry_decisions, PURE — no gh/network)
#   For each candidate comment — authored by a trusted registered reviewer bot,
#   not agent-marked, not minimized RESOLVED, not cleared by its source's
#   info_status_pattern (the same filters the gate applies) — whether to dispatch
#   a fix-bot-comment retry now. A comment's VERSION is lastEditedAt // createdAt;
#   all coverage checks are against the current version, so an edit re-opens it.
#     dispositioned            a `dev-lead:comment-disposition id=<id>` reply exists
#                              at/after the version → covered, nothing to do
#     pass-completed           a fix-bot-comment pass already ended on this version
#                              (its terminal marker carries `comment=<id>` and the
#                              `version=` it processed) without a disposition → do
#                              not loop; only an edit re-opens
#     retry-pending            a retry marker for this version is younger than the
#                              pending window → that retry may still be queued or
#                              running; never duplicate it
#     rate-limited             a fix-bot-comment pass on this PR ended rate-limited
#                              (or blocked) and its reset= time is still ahead
#     retry-attempts-exhausted this version already had MAX retry attempts since the
#                              last rate-limited end (an attempt that ended rate-
#                              limited does not count), or MAX_TOTAL in all
#     grace-period             the comment is too new — the original event-driven
#                              run may still be pending or running
#     (dispatch)               otherwise, as attempt <previous attempts + 1>
#
#   Only markers posted by our own automation count: the author's login must be
#   one of <automation_logins_csv> (dev-lead's and pr-review's acting identities)
#   AND carry a trusted association (OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR). Neither an outside
#   commenter nor another repository member can forge a disposition that
#   suppresses the retry or a marker that blocks it (CWE-863). This matches the
#   resolver, which only honours a disposition authored by dev-lead's identity
#   (cdv_select_disposition).
#
# SECURITY: nothing here (or in the sweep that uses it) minimizes or resolves a
#   comment. A retry only causes dev-lead to post a disposition, which the harness
#   then verifies as usual (resolve_dispositioned_comments). The gate is unchanged.
#
# Tunables (env):
#   BOT_COMMENT_RETRY_MIN_AGE_SEC   grace for the original run (default 900 = 15 min)
#   BOT_COMMENT_RETRY_PENDING_SEC   how long a dispatched retry is treated as still
#                                   pending/running (default 9000 = 150 min: the
#                                   dispatch job's 120-min timeout plus queue time)
#   BOT_COMMENT_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS  retries per comment version since the last
#                                   rate-limited end (default 2)
#   BOT_COMMENT_RETRY_MAX_TOTAL     hard ceiling on retries per comment version,
#                                   rate-limited ones included (default 6)
#   BOT_COMMENT_RETRY_VERSION_SKEW_SEC  tolerance when matching a pass's stamped
#                                   version to the comment's version (default 2):
#                                   an edited comment's version comes from the
#                                   webhook's updated_at, which can trail GraphQL's
#                                   lastEditedAt by a second

# The gate's agent-marker regex and info-status registry reader — one source of
