# addressed-claim-verify.sh — the pure verifier that turns the dev-lead
# addressed-marker into a *verifiable claim* against the pushed diff (#1692,
# epic #1621 story 2 of 2; blocked-by #1691).
#
# WHAT IS WRONG WITHOUT THIS
#   resolve_addressed_bot_threads() (dev-lead-fix-reviews.sh) resolved a bot thread
#   the moment its LAST reply carried `<!-- dev-lead:addressed -->` and was authored
#   by our account. It verified WHO claimed and THAT a claim was made — never
#   WHETHER the claim was true. On petry-projects/.github PR #1044 three functions
#   were byte-identical between two commits, carried addressed-markers, and were
#   resolved exactly as designed. It also read `comments(last:1)` only, so an earlier
#   maintainer "ACCEPTED — required before merge" reply went invisible the moment the
#   model appended its own marker after it.
#
# THE CLAIM PAYLOAD SCHEMA (normative — the single source of truth)
#   The addressed reply carries TWO HTML comments. The existing marker is unchanged
#   (so review_reply_is_addressed_marker keeps working); the claim is ADDITIVE:
#
#     Fixed in scripts/lib/auto-merge.sh: added `set -euo pipefail` ...
#
#     <!-- dev-lead:addressed -->
#     <!-- dev-lead:claim {"v":1,"sha":"<40-hex>","files":["path/a","path/b"]} -->
#
#   Field contract:
#     v      integer. 1 today. An unrecognised v is unverifiable -> do not resolve
#            (fail closed), never "assume v1".
#     sha    full 40-character commit SHA. Abbreviated SHAs are rejected.
#     files  JSON array of repo-relative POSIX paths exactly as they appear in the
#            diff (no leading ./ or /, no quoting). Must be non-empty. Parsed with jq
#            (never IFS/cut/tr) so paths with spaces/commas/unicode are safe.
#
#   Extraction: exactly ONE claim comment per reply. Zero -> unverifiable (the
#   pre-migration case). More than one -> malformed. Do not "take the last one."
#
# PURITY / TESTABILITY
#   Every acv_* function except acv_gather_commit_facts is PURE: no network, no git,
#   no gh — inputs are the claim payload, diff file lists, and thread comments. That
#   is what makes the verifier exhaustively bats-testable offline. The single impure
#   gatherer (acv_gather_commit_facts) isolates all `git` calls, mirroring the
#   pure/impure split the repo uses elsewhere. Sourced under `set -euo pipefail`, so
#   the pure helpers only `return`, never `exit`, and fail closed on every ambiguity.
