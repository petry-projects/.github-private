# pr-review-outcomes.sh — pure helpers for the pr-review run-outcome-by-event
# breakdown surfaced on the daily health report (#1422 AC #1, epic #1402).
#
# The pr-review concurrency model admits one running + one pending run per group;
# a third same-group event evicts the older PENDING run, which concludes as
# `cancelled`. Over the 2026-08-02 observation window ~49% of runs were cancelled,
# and a cancelled run rendered as a failing check (#1421). Making the outcome mix a
# TRACKED number — split by the triggering event, since the fan-in is per-event —
# is what turns that cancellation rate from an anecdote into a monitored metric.
#
# These functions are PURE: they take run telemetry JSON on argv and write to
# stdout. No network, no side effects. Unit-tested in tests/pr_review_outcomes.bats.
# main-side network I/O lives in scripts/pr_review_health.sh, which sources this.

# pr_review_outcomes_by_event <runs_json>
#   Input : JSON array of run objects, each carrying {event, conclusion} as
#           returned by the GitHub Actions runs API (.event / .conclusion).
#   Output: TSV, one row per triggering event (sorted by event name) followed by a
#           TOTAL row:
#             event<TAB>success<TAB>cancelled<TAB>skipped<TAB>failure<TAB>total
#           `total` is the count of ALL runs for the event (so in-flight/other
#           conclusions are still counted in the denominator, not silently
#           dropped). A run with a null event folds into an "unknown" bucket.
#           Absent/empty JSON → a single zeroed TOTAL row.
