# git-history.sh — make the merge base of HEAD and origin/<base> resolvable on a
# shallow checkout (#2053).
#
# actions/checkout defaults to a depth-1 clone: only the tip of each ref is
# present, so a PR branch and its base appear to share no ancestor. A three-dot
# diff, a trial merge, or `git rebase origin/<base>` then sees "unrelated
# histories". A plain `git fetch origin <base>` does NOT deepen a shallow
# checkout, so history must be deepened explicitly. This is the single copy of
# that logic — the rebase arm, pr_nets_to_zero and net-diff-guard.sh all use it.
#
# Two entry points:
#   git_history_deepen    <base> [head_ref] — best-effort deepen; always rc 0.
#   git_ensure_merge_base <base> [head_ref] — deepen, then verify:
#       0 → merge base of HEAD and origin/<base> resolves
#       1 → history is complete but there is no merge base (genuinely unrelated)
#       2 → history could not be deepened, or origin/<base> could not be
#           fetched: an infrastructure failure, NOT a conflict.

# git_history_deepen <base> [head_ref] — if the repo is shallow, un-shallow it;
# if that is refused, fall back to a deep fetch of the base and head refs.
# Best-effort: never fails the caller, which decides what an incomplete history
# means for it.
