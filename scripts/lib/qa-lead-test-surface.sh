# qa-lead-test-surface.sh — the pure test-surface heuristic for the qa-lead PR
# advisory (issue #1646 — [qa-lead S3]).
#
# S3 wires a Class 1 pull_request:[opened, ready_for_review] trigger for qa-lead
# (the 2026-09-07 ruling; synchronize deliberately NOT wired). This heuristic is
# the ONLY thing standing between "qa-lead becomes useful" and "qa-lead becomes
# noise" (AC #3): it decides, from the PR's changed-file set alone, whether the
# PR carries REAL test surface worth an advisory.
#
# The rule: qa-lead advises on a PR that either
#   * touches test surface (any changed path under tests/, a *.bats file, or a
#     conventional test filename), OR
#   * changes source code with NO accompanying test change.
# It stays silent on docs-only PRs and on verbatim stub-sync PRs (workflow /
# config yaml only) — a PR with nothing of test-relevance is noise even if each
# comment would be individually correct.
#
# Pure and sourced: no network, no gh, no PR context — just string classification
# so every case is pinned by tests/test_qa_lead_test_surface.bats.

# qa_lead_classify_path <path> -> prints one of TEST | DOCS | SOURCE | OTHER
#   TEST wins over everything (a *_test.go under docs/ is still a test), so it is
#   checked first. OTHER is the "no test surface" bucket: workflow/config yaml,
#   json manifests, anything not recognised as code, tests, or docs.

# qa_lead_paths_have_control_char <json_array_of_paths>
#   Exit 0 iff any path in the JSON array contains a control character (NUL, LF,

#   text, so a filename that itself contains an LF would split into phantom
#   records — e.g. a lone `docs/a.md\nscripts/x.sh` doc would fabricate a SOURCE
#   path and trigger the advisory on a docs-only PR (#1697 review). The workflow
#   validates the raw JSON list with this predicate BEFORE flattening and fails
#   closed (skip) when it returns true, so a control character can never forge a
#   test/source record.

# qa_lead_file_list_complete <received_count> <declared_count>

#   GitHub's GET /pulls/{n}/files endpoint caps at 3000 files (including paginated
#   results), so a PR that changes more than that yields a truncated list. Deciding
#   the gate from a partial list could omit a test/source path and mislabel the PR;
#   the workflow fails closed (skip) on an incomplete list rather than advise off
#   partial data (#1697 review). Boundary: 3000/3000 is complete, 3000/3001 is not.
