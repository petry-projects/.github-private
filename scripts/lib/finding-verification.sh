# finding-verification.sh — agentic iterative validation post-processor for the
# deep review tier (issue #1092, epic #1088).
#
# WHAT / WHY
#   The deep tier now attempts to *confirm* a suspected logic/correctness finding
#   by running the repo's relevant lint/test tool before it is reported, so
#   plausible-but-wrong findings stop reaching reviewers. The deep tier does the
#   repro itself (it already has a Bash tool) and records the outcome on each such
#   finding as a `verification` field:
#     - "confirmed"    the repro reproduced the bug              -> keep as-is
#     - "refuted"      the repro tool ran and did NOT reproduce  -> downgrade one
#                      severity (or drop when already `info`)
#     - "unverifiable" no runnable lint/test target maps to it   -> keep as-is
#   This function is the pure-shell discipline layer over those tags: it applies
#   the downgrade/drop, tags the message auditable, and emits one
#   kind:"finding_verification" record per processed finding (via
#   emit_verification_record in token-metrics.sh) so the false-positive-rate delta
#   is measurable. It uses the same record kind and downgrade discipline as other
#   finding post-processors, so token_report.sh aggregation and the FP-rate math
#   work without further changes.
#
# PRIVILEGE / TIMEOUT GUARD (AC #3)
#   This function runs NO external tools — it is jq-only. The actual repro happens
#   inside the deep tier's existing `run_agentic` invocation, which already runs
#   with `--allowed-tools Bash,Read,Grep,Glob` and is wrapped by `timeout
#   $DEEP_TIMEOUT_SEC` (engine.sh). Validation therefore adds ZERO new tool
#   permissions and ZERO new network/write access, and cannot hang the review
#   because it inherits the per-tier timeout. It must never run in the writer/action
#   tier (the only tier with Write) — it is wired only after the deep tier.
#
# REWARD-HACKING GUARD (AC #4)
#   Only `refuted` (the repro tool actively failed to reproduce) downgrades/drops a
#   finding. `unverifiable` (absence of a runnable target) NEVER downgrades — that
#   would let a validator that maps nothing silently drop real findings to game the
#   FP-rate. Non-logic-class findings are never touched.
#
# Usage: source this file, then call:
#   apply_finding_verification <deep_json_file> [workflow] [tier] [context]
#     - mutates <deep_json_file> in place (downgrades/drops findings)
#     - never fails: a missing/invalid file or absent jq is a clean no-op
