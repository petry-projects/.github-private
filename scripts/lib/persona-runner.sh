# scripts/lib/persona-runner.sh — Persona runtime core (dispatch side)
#
# The other half of the mention framework. The router
# (petry-projects/.github scripts/lib/persona-mention.sh) resolves an
# `@petry-projects/<role>` mention and fires a `persona-mention`
# repository_dispatch at this repo; this library backs the workflow that
# receives it and runs the addressed persona's advisory prompt.
#
# ONE runner serves EVERY persona — it is manifest/convention driven, not one
# workflow per persona (§4.1: per-agent workflows are the drift the framework
# exists to prevent). It resolves the persona's advisory prompt by convention
# (prompts/<id>/advisory.md) exactly as the router resolves the manifest by
# convention (personas/<id>/persona.yml).

# The recursion marker is shared with the router, on purpose

# Every comment a persona posts MUST begin with '<!-- persona:<id> -->'. The
# router's pm_is_agent_comment skips any comment carrying '<!-- persona:', so a
# persona's own advisory cannot re-summon it (or any persona named in the
# thread). This is axis 2 of the router's guard, closed from the writing side.
