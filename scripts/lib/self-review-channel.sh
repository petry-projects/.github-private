# self-review-channel.sh — SC2 self-review-duty channel-tier guard (#1624).
#
# Safe Release SC2 (epic #495 / story #503): a deliberately-broken in-development
# version of this repo's agentic review/merge duty must NOT be able to block the
# PR that fixes its own breakage. For `.github-private`'s dev/merge duty the
# structural property that guarantees this is that `dev-lead.yml` pins its
# reusable to a **stable-tier** channel (`@dev-lead/v1-stable`) even though this
# repo sits in ring `next` — so a broken `next` cannot, by construction, gate its
# own fix. This is the sanctioned SC2 exception the `pinned-version-report`
# ring-mismatch flag calls out (see docs/release/versioning.md,
# docs/initiatives/agentic-release-strategy.md).
#
# These are pure helpers with no side effects and no network: they parse the
# `uses:` channel pin from a caller stub and classify its TIER. "stable-tier"
# means the channel tier, not a literal string — both the major-scoped
# `v1-stable` and the legacy bare `stable` qualify; `v1-next`, `next`, `ring0`,
# `@main`, and bare SHAs do not.
#
# Sourced by tests/test_sc2_self_review_channel.bats. This file defines functions
# only (no top-level `set -euo pipefail`), matching the repo's sourceable-lib
# convention (e.g. scripts/lib/holdout-guard.sh).

# src_stub_uses_ref <stub_file>
#   Echo the ref of the first reusable-workflow caller pin — the token after the
#   final `@` on a `uses: …/<workflow>.yml@<ref>` line — with the trailing inline
#   `# NOSONAR …` comment and surrounding whitespace stripped. Returns non-zero
#   if the file has no such pin.

  read -r ref <<<"${stripped##*@}"       # token after the last @, whitespace-trimmed
  [ -n "$ref" ] || return 1

# src_stub_agent_ref <stub_file>
#   Echo the value of the caller's `agent_ref:` input — the token after
#   `agent_ref:` — with any inline comment and surrounding whitespace stripped.
#   Returns non-zero if the file declares no such input. This is the ref
#   dev-lead's own scripts/prompts are CHECKED OUT from (dev-lead-reusable.yml
#   `inputs.agent_ref`, consumed at the `ref:` of its `actions/checkout` steps),
#   so for the SC2 duty it must be stable-tier just like the `uses:` pin — a
#   stable reusable driven by a `next` `agent_ref` would still run the actual
#   review/merge logic from an unsafe channel.

#   (e.g. `v1-stable`). The tier is the suffix of a major-scoped
#   `v<MAJOR>-<tier>` channel, or a bare `<tier>` (pre-#1184 legacy form).
#   Recognised tiers: stable | next | ring<N>. Returns non-zero for anything
#   that is not a channel tier at all (`main`, a bare commit SHA, …).
