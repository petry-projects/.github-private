#!/usr/bin/env bash
# claim-landing.sh — "did the push land, and which claims must be retracted?" as
# pure verdicts (#2013).
#
# WHAT IS WRONG WITHOUT THIS
#   The fix-reviews / fix-bot-comment model posts its "Fixed in …" reply (with the
#   addressed-marker + #1692 claim) from its OWN shell, BEFORE the harness commits
#   and pushes. On petry-projects/.github#1220 that left false "Fixed" replies
#   standing when the push never landed, and when the claim named the PR's FIRST
#   commit (a stale pre-pass head). Separately, CodeRabbit marked a thread
#   "✅ Confirmed as addressed" on a reply describing `15a919e`, which WAS pushed:
#   a wrong fix (a new test added, an existing one broken without being edited)
#   cleared a review gate. Landing checks cannot catch that one; the
#   test-regression guard does.
#   The #1692 claim check ran only at thread-RESOLUTION time; nothing ever took a
#   posted claim back.
#
# THE CONTRACT
#   - cl_push_landed_verdict decides, from SHAs alone, whether the pass's pushed
#     commit is on the remote head. commit_and_push treats anything but `landed` as
#     a failed push.
#   - cl_select_pass_claims picks OUR claim/marker replies created during this pass.
#   - each selected claim is checked with acv_claim_in_pass against the REMOTE head
#     (addressed-claim-verify.sh); any that fails is rewritten with cl_retract_body,
#     which strips both markers so the reply can never authorize resolution again.
#     A claim whose commit the push guard rebased onto a foreign commit is first
#     re-pointed at its rebased successor (cl_map_sha + cl_rewrite_claim_sha, #2032).
#   - at the START of every pass, cl_select_earlier_claims picks OUR claim replies
#     from earlier passes (a cancelled run never reached its own sweep, #2032) and
#     cl_earlier_claim_verdict decides each: an unlanded one is retracted, and a
#     retracted one whose fix is on the remote head is restored (cl_restore_body).
#
# PURITY / TESTABILITY (ADR-0004)
#   Every cl_* function except cl_remote_head is PURE: no network, no git, no gh.
#   cl_remote_head is the single impure reader. Sourced under `set -euo pipefail`,
#   so helpers only `return`, never `exit`, and fail closed on every ambiguity.
