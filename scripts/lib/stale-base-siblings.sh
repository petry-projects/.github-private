# stale-base-siblings.sh — bounded audit for the #1607 stale-base fingerprint.
#
# A stale-base force-push (the #1604 defect) leaves a detectable trace: the
# discarded commit and the commit that replaced it share the SAME parent —
# dev-lead rebuilt from a cached base commit instead of the true branch head,
# so two commits hang off one parent. On #1604:
#     75f5850e (maintainer)  parent b7a9fa68
#     e938c584 (dev-lead)    parent b7a9fa68   <- same parent = sibling pair
#
# detect_stale_base_siblings reads "<sha> <parent>" lines on stdin (one commit
# per line, as emitted by `git rev-list --parents` reduced to first-parent, or
# `git log --format='%H %P'`) and flags any parent that has more than one child.
#
# Exit status:
#   0  clean — every parent has at most one child (linear history)
#   1  at least one sibling group found (a stale-base fingerprint); the offending
#      parent and its children are printed to stdout for the audit report.
