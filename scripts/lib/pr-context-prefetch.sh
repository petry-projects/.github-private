# Shared PR-context prefetch for the review cascade (epic #1101, Story 2 / #1103).
#
# Gather the FULL PR diff + a superset metadata JSON ONCE in review-one-pr.sh and
# persist them to files bound to PR_HEAD_SHA, exposed to the agentic tiers
# (deep / audit / single / rubber-duck) as PR_CONTEXT_DIFF_FILE and
# PR_CONTEXT_METADATA_FILE. This is a single authoritative pre-populated context
# the tiers can consume instead of each re-fetching the diff/metadata themselves.
#
# Gated DEFAULT-OFF behind PREFETCH_CONTEXT_ENABLED so the change is a safe no-op
# until explicitly enabled: when off, zero files are written and zero env vars are
# exported, keeping the tier prompts and their inputs byte-identical to
# pre-feature behavior (mirrors the DOWNSTREAM_IMPACT_ENABLED default-off idiom).
#
# This is PLUMBING ONLY (Story 2): it does not change any tier prompt. Consumers
# in Story 5 verify the persisted PR_HEAD_SHA stamp for freshness before use.

# Superset of every field the deep/audit/single prompts read
# (headRepository, headRepositoryOwner) and the rubber-duck prompt reads
# (repository) via `gh pr view`. Persisting the union — with the FULL, non-simplified
# `files` array — means no tier loses a field it uses today. This is intentionally
# richer than review-one-pr.sh's triage `_meta_fields`, which simplifies `files`
# and omits headRepository/repository/reviews/comments/commits, so the triage
# metadata copy is insufficient for the agentic tiers and one full fetch is done here.

# prefetch_pr_context <pr_url> <pr_head_sha> <full_diff_file> [out_dir]
#
#   Persists, under <out_dir> (default /tmp/cascade):
#     pr-context-diff.txt      — the FULL diff, header-stamped with PR_HEAD_SHA
#     pr-context-metadata.json — the superset metadata, stamped as .pr_head_sha
#   and exports their paths as PR_CONTEXT_DIFF_FILE / PR_CONTEXT_METADATA_FILE.
#
#   Fetch discipline (AC #4): the FULL diff is REUSED from <full_diff_file> — the
#   untruncated copy review-one-pr.sh already fetched during triage (either
#   `gh pr diff` or the per-file REST assembly on the >300-file 406 fallback) —
#   so no extra diff fetch happens here. Exactly ONE additional `gh pr view` is
#   performed for the superset metadata, because triage's metadata copy is
#   insufficient (simplified `files`, missing fields).
#
#   Gating (AC #1): a no-op returning 0 unless PREFETCH_CONTEXT_ENABLED=true.
#
#   Degradation (AC #5): a gh rate-limit on the metadata fetch returns the skip
#   sentinel 100 so the caller can take the existing skip path (exit 100) rather
#   than crashing; any other metadata-fetch failure degrades to a no-op (returns
#   0, no files, no exports) so the run continues on the tiers' own fetches. The
#   >300-file 406 case is already handled upstream (the reused diff is the REST
#   assembly), so it never reaches this helper.

# assert_prefetch_context_fresh <pr_url> [out_dir]
#
#   HEAD-SHA freshness safeguard (epic #1101, Story 5 / #1106). Run ONCE just
#   before the agentic tiers (deep / audit / single) consume the pre-fed
#   context, this cheaply re-checks the PR's CURRENT head SHA against the SHA
#   prefetch_pr_context stamped on the pre-fed files — closing the window where a
#   force-push / new push mid-run could otherwise let a tier review stale code.
#
#   Fetch discipline (AC #4): bounded to a SINGLE lightweight
#   `gh pr view --json headRefOid` — never a full metadata/diff re-fetch.
#
#   Gating (AC #4): a no-op returning 0 (doing NO gh call) unless
#   PREFETCH_CONTEXT_ENABLED=true. Also a no-op when no pre-fed context was
#   exported (no stamp to validate).
#
#   Returns:
#     0   — flag off, nothing pre-fed, OR current head SHA still matches the
#           stamp (AC #2: pre-fed context is fresh — used as-is, no extra fetch).
#     100 — HEAD moved (AC #3): the stale pre-fed context is INVALIDATED (files
#           removed, PR_CONTEXT_* exports unset) so no tier can consume it; the
#           caller takes the exit-100 skip sentinel to retry at the new SHA (the
#           idempotency marker prevents a duplicate review).
#
#   A gh failure on the check degrades to 0 (proceed on the existing stamped
#   context) rather than crashing: the context is already SHA-bound and this is a
#   belt-and-suspenders safeguard, so a transient gh blip must not force a
