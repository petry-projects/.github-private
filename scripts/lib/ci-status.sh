# compute_ci_status <rollup_json> [required_names_json]
#
# Inputs:
#   $1 — JSON array (the .statusCheckRollup field from `gh pr view`)
#   $2 — (optional) JSON array of the branch ruleset's required status-check
#        contexts, read from GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/{branch}
#        (#1795). When non-empty this is the AUTHORITATIVE required set.
#
# Outputs (stdout): one of "passing", "pending", "failing"
#
# Required-check gating (#1549, #1795): after own/agent filtering, classification
# gates ONLY on the REQUIRED checks — a red NON-required check (a superseded
# 'dev-lead / dispatch', or 'template-drift' from a repo-template Dependabot bump /
# a standards baseline move) no longer blocks the review that would approve an
# otherwise-green PR.
#
# The required set is the UNION of two signals, so it is never narrower than either:
#   • ruleset names ($2) — the authoritative source read from the branch ruleset
#     API by the caller (review-one-pr.sh). This repo protects `main` with a
#     ruleset, not classic protection, so the rollup's own .isRequired field is
#     frequently ABSENT (the #1795 deadlock: with nothing flagged required the
#     #1549 fallback reverts to all-external and template-drift blocks every PR).
#   • .isRequired == true — GitHub's per-entry verdict, honoured whenever present
#     so a genuinely-required check can never slip the gate even if the ruleset
#     name set is stale or a context string does not match.
# When BOTH are empty (caller passed nothing / the ruleset API was unreadable —
# fail closed), the gate falls back to evaluating EVERY external check (today's
# behaviour, fail-safe): a genuine failure is never silently passed.
#
# Classification rules (after filtering own checks, over the gated set):
#   passing — empty rollup, or every item is SUCCESS/SKIPPED/NEUTRAL/CANCELLED
#             conclusion or SUCCESS state
#   pending — any item is IN_PROGRESS/QUEUED/WAITING/PENDING/EXPECTED or
#             COMPLETED with null/empty conclusion
#   failing — anything else (FAILURE, ACTION_REQUIRED, TIMED_OUT, etc.)
#
# CANCELLED is treated as non-blocking, not failing (issue #608). dev-lead's
# orchestration jobs (dev-lead / dispatch, dev-lead / ci-relay) are routinely
# cancelled by dev-lead's own concurrency when a run is superseded, leaving
# terminal CANCELLED check-runs on the PR. A cancelled check is not a failed
# check, so it must not block the review gate. It is non-blocking rather than
# pending because a superseded check never completes — classifying it pending
# would leave the PR perpetually un-reviewable.
#
# Own-check filter — excludes entries belonging to the PR Review cascade.
#   `gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup` exposes the check/job *name* but not
#   the workflow name (gh/cli#9091), so the PR Review Agent's single job appears
#   with its bare job name in the rollup: "review".
#   This is matched explicitly to prevent the cascade from blocking on its own
#   pending check run. Compound "workflow / job" forms are also matched for
#   reusable-workflow callers where that format does appear.
#   Dev-Lead bare checks ("dispatch", "ci-relay") are NOT filtered because
#   Dev-Lead can commit back to the PR branch; filtering them could cause a review
#   to race an in-progress branch-mutating run.
#   Matched:
#   • Bare job name: "review"
#   • Nested job form "review / review" — produced once the cascade is invoked
#     via the trigger stub (pr-review-trigger.yml → reusable pr-review.yml@
#     pr-review/stable), where the rollup name becomes "callerJob / reusableJob"
#     rather than the bare job name (#497 self-host). Matched exactly (not by a
#     "/ review" suffix) so a genuine external "Build / review" is NOT filtered.
#   • "PR Review Agent / *"
#   • "PR Review Reusable / *"
#   • "PR Review — Mention Trigger / *"

# Shared jq `def is_own_check` — the PR Review cascade's own check runs, excluded
# by both compute_ci_status and classify_rollup_eventability so neither blocks nor
# misclassifies the cascade on its own output. Kept in one place to prevent drift.

# that already names each role and its workflows — and passed in via `$agent_roles`.
#
# A role's check runs surface in the rollup as the nested "<role> / <job>" form

# We match that exact shape (name == role, or name starts with "<role> / ") so a
