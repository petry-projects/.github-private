# merge-queue-dequeue.sh — remove a PR from the merge queue when the fleet has
# withdrawn its last approval (issue #2174).
#
# GitHub evaluates a ruleset's review requirement when a PR JOINS the merge queue
# and does not re-evaluate it when the queue merges. So an approval dismissed
# after the PR was enqueued no longer stops the merge (PR 2084, 2026-10-10:
# approved, enqueued, approval dismissed, merged while REVIEW_REQUIRED).
#
# Call mq_dequeue_if_unapproved AFTER every dismissal in the run AND after the
# run's new verdict has been posted. It reads the LIVE state, never what the
# caller just did: a re-review that dismissed the old approval and posted a new
# one leaves an approval standing, so the PR stays queued.
#
# Sourced by scripts/post-pr-review.sh and scripts/invalidate-standing-approval.sh.
# Every failure path logs and returns 0 — this must never fail the caller's run.

# Marker on the single notice posted per head SHA. The `pr-review-agent` prefix
# keeps it out of maintainer-comment-gate.sh's blocker set; the absence of `v1`
# keeps it out of the review-marker regexes (cleanup, cycle counting).

## Removed from the merge queue: approval withdrawn

The automated review withdrew its approval while this PR was in the merge queue, and no other approval stands for the current head commit \`${head}\`. GitHub checks reviews only when a PR joins the queue, not when the queue merges it, so the PR was removed from the queue to stop it merging without an approval.

**What happens next:** the PR needs an approval for its head commit again. Address the review findings, or a maintainer approves it. Once an approval stands, dev-lead re-enables auto-merge on its next pass and the PR rejoins the queue; a maintainer can also re-add it by hand.

The automated review withdrew its approval while this PR was in the merge queue, and no other approval stands for the current head commit \`${head}\`. GitHub checks reviews only when a PR joins the queue, so the queue can still merge this PR. The automatic removal failed.

**A maintainer must remove this PR from the merge queue by hand** (the merge box on the PR page, "Remove from queue"). After that, the PR needs an approval for its head commit before it can rejoin the queue.
