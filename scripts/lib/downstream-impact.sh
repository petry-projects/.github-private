# Pure downstream-impact mapping helper for the PR-review cascade (issue #750,
# epic #748).
#
# Given a PR's changed-file list and the consumer manifest (Story 1,
# scripts/lib/consumer-manifest.json), this answers a single question with NO
# network / `gh` I/O: which shared surfaces did these files touch, and which
# org repos (consumers) pin those surfaces? Keeping it pure makes the impact
# computation deterministic and unit-testable in isolation (mirrors the
# jq-program style of scripts/lib/review-cycle.sh).
#
# Matching is single-hop and EXACT-path (issue #653) — no prefix/glob/transitive
# source-graph expansion. Two and only two match kinds:
#   (a) a changed reusable-workflow path that a consumer ref pins exactly
#       (after normalising the manifest's provider prefix) -> direct surface;
#   (b) a changed scripts/lib/*.sh or prompts/* path listed in a reusable's
#       surface_sources -> that reusable surface -> the reusable's consumers.
#
# A consumer ref is provider-prefixed (e.g. ".github-private/.github/workflows/
# pr-review.yml") while a surface is identified by its repo-relative path
# (".github/workflows/pr-review.yml", the surface_sources key form). Normalising
# strips the longest matching declared provider prefix so the helper is
# provider-agnostic — it never hardcodes which provider repo it runs in.
#
# Output (always a single well-formed JSON object on stdout):
#   {
#     "impacted_surfaces":  [ "<repo-relative reusable path>", ... ],   # sorted, unique
#     "impacted_consumers": [ { "repo": "...", "via": ["<surface>", ...] }, ... ],
#     "unmatched":          [ "<changed path with no shared surface>", ... ]
#   }
#
# Defensive degradation (same philosophy as compute_review_cycle returning 0 on
# bad input): a missing/unreadable/malformed manifest, an empty changed-file
# list, or any jq failure yields the empty-but-well-formed object below rather
# than a non-zero exit that would break the cascade.

# jq program shared by the one public function. Inputs:
#   $changed : JSON array of changed paths (de-duplicated, blanks removed)
#   $m       : slurpfile array; $m[0] is the manifest object
