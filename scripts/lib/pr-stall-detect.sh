# pr-stall-detect.sh — the STALL DETECTION net for the Class-2 timer narrowing
# (issue #1410, epic #1402). The instrument built BEFORE `dev-lead-retry` and
# `pr-review-sweep` are narrowed (#1407 / #1408), so a genuinely un-eventable
# transition that used to be caught only by the cron backstop is still caught —
# as a PUSHED signal — instead of stalling unseen.
#
# It is the mirror image of scripts/lib/pr-runaway-detect.sh: the runaway net
# flags a PR with too MUCH automated activity; this net flags one with too
# LITTLE — an open PR that is CI-green and REVIEW_REQUIRED (awaiting an automated
# review step), with no agent activity and no pending triggering event, for
# longer than a configurable threshold. That is the precise failure mode a
# narrowed timer could introduce: CI settles green with no `workflow_run` fast
# path (a cross-repo or GitHub-App check like SonarCloud), and once the cron is
# narrowed nothing re-dispatches the review.
#
# Like pr-runaway-detect.sh this is a set of PURE functions given already-gathered
# PR metrics; it NEVER mutates a PR. Surfacing is the caller's job
# (scripts/pr_stall_scan.sh, wired into the daily health check — no new cron).

#   is_pr_stall <...same args...>
#     Exit 0 when the PR is stalled, 1 otherwise.
#   pr_stall_is_gated <labels_json>
#     Exit 0 (GATED → never a stall) when the PR carries an INTENTIONAL, human-
#     gated stop: needs-human-review, dev-lead:hands-off, or initiative:hold.

# activity) is a stall CANDIDATE. Default 30 min: double the pr-review-sweep
# scheduled backstop cadence (≤15 min, `2,17,32,47 * * * *`), so a candidate has
# outlived at least two full backstop windows — a genuine stall, not a PR merely
# in flight. Env-overridable (AC#1).
# TASK FOR #1408: when pr-review-sweep's cron is narrowed, re-derive this default
