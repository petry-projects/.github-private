# miss-harvest.sh — harvest accepted pr-review misses into eval regression cases (#1596).
#
# When the deterministic miss-rate metric (scripts/lib/pr-review-miss-rate.sh)
# identifies an ACCEPTED miss — a real defect a trusted advisory bot found on a PR
# pr-review had already approved — that miss is the free, perfectly-labelled source
# of truth for a regression case. This library turns one miss into a de-identified
# case line for evals/deep-review/dev/cases.jsonl.
#
# ── HARD INVARIANT: dev/ ONLY, never holdout/ ────────────────────────────────
# Harvested cases go to the dev split ONLY. holdout/ is CODEOWNER-gated and
# holdout-guard.yml hard-fails proposer-authored PRs touching evals/; the whole
# point of the split is that the proposer must never see the cases it is scored
# against (#1088). Auto-harvesting into holdout/ would silently destroy the one
# control that makes the eval's success metric meaningful. mh_assert_dev_path is
# the belt-and-braces guard: any target path under a holdout/ segment is refused,
# and mh_harvest writes NOTHING when the guard trips.
#
# ── De-identification (evals/README.md decision A3) ──────────────────────────
# Cases are world-readable within the org and the dev split is proposer-visible,
# so a case must carry no raw URLs, @mentions, secrets/tokens, or PII. mh_build_case
# scrubs those into placeholders before the case is ever written.

# Default target: the deep-review dev split.
