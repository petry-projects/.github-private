# pr-mergeready-detect.sh — the MERGE-READY-AND-IDLE detection net (issue #1469,
# epic #1402). The third member of the runaway (#948) / stall (#1410) detection
# family, all wired into the daily health check as PUSHED signals (the #860
# lesson: detection must be pushed, not pulled).
#
#   • runaway (pr-runaway-detect.sh) flags a PR with too MUCH automated activity.
#   • stall   (pr-stall-detect.sh)   flags a PR awaiting an automated REVIEW step.
#   • this net flags a PR that is fully MERGE-READY — reviewDecision APPROVED,
#     mergeable MERGEABLE, all required checks green — yet has sat idle past a
#     threshold with NO agent acting and NOTHING reporting that. #1451 sat exactly
#     this way for 77h and merged only when a human noticed it in a PR-list sweep.
#
# "merge-ready but idle" is a DISTINCT failure mode from the two adjacent ones the
# detector must not conflate (AC#2), so triage doesn't re-diagnose which of the
# three a stalled PR is in:
#   • #1425 — agent-blocked-by-untrusted-bot: an UNRESOLVED review thread from a
#             bot OUTSIDE TRUSTED_BOTS that no agent is authorized to resolve. Here
#             an agent WOULD act if it could. Classified `agent-blocked`.
#   • #1427 — reviewer-defers-on-pending-check: a pending / zombie check that makes
#             pr-review defer (ci_status == "pending"). Here an agent is actively
#             (if wrongly) deferring. Classified `reviewer-defer`.
# Neither is double-counted as merge-ready (AC#4); each is classified distinctly.
#
# Like its siblings this is a set of PURE functions given already-gathered PR
# metrics; it NEVER mutates a PR (AC#3). Surfacing is the caller's job
# (scripts/pr_mergeready_scan.sh, wired into the daily health check — no new cron).
#
# The public functions (args, unless noted, are:
#   <review_decision> <mergeable> <ci_status> <agent_blocked> <hours_idle> <gated>):
#   pr_mergeready_shape ...
#     Prints the three-way classification of a would-be-ready idle PR:
#     "merge-ready-idle" | "agent-blocked" | "reviewer-defer" | "" (not applicable).
#   pr_mergeready_reasons ...
#     Prints one reason line ONLY for the merge-ready-idle shape; empty otherwise.
#   is_pr_mergeready ...
#     Exit 0 iff the PR is merge-ready-and-idle (the flag; excludes the two shapes).
#   pr_mergeready_is_gated <labels_json>
#     Exit 0 (GATED → never flagged) on an intentional human-gated stop.
#   pr_mergeready_thread_agent_blocked <threads_json> <trusted_bots_csv>
#     Exit 0 when an UNRESOLVED review thread is authored by a Bot outside the
#     trusted set — the #1425 discriminator computed by the scan from the PR's
#     review threads.
#   pr_mergeready_hours_since <iso8601> [now_epoch]
#     Whole hours between a timestamp and now (default: current time).
#   generate_mergeready_report <candidates_tsv_file>

#
#   Only BOT-authored threads are classified here (author.__typename == "Bot"): the
