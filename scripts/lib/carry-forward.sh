# Carry-forward for conflict-free base merges (issue #1865).
#
# The problem: `strict_required_status_checks_policy: true` forces every open PR
# to be up to date with the base branch, so auto-rebase.yml merges the base into
# each open PR after every merge — minting a NEW head SHA on each. pr-review keys
# its idempotency on the head SHA (#899), so each of those PRs gets a fresh full
# tier stack even though the DIFF AGAINST THE MERGE-BASE is byte-identical and the
# prior verdict still holds. Landing one PR thus forces a full re-review of every
# other open PR.
#
# The fix: when pr-review is triggered on a PR whose last recorded verdict was for
# an EARLIER head SHA, and the only intervening commits are conflict-free merges
# from the base branch that leave the diff-vs-merge-base unchanged, carry the prior
# verdict forward to the new SHA instead of re-running any model tier.
#
# FAIL TOWARD REVIEWING. Any delta that is not provably a conflict-free base merge
# — a content commit, a conflict resolution (which IS content authorship and has
# historically corrupted files here, #1482/#1485), a merge of a foreign branch, a
# changed base, or an indeterminable comparison (API failure / unparseable) — falls
# through to a normal full review. There is no path where an unknown state skips
# review (#1865 AC #4).
#
# Architecture note: the pr-review runner checks out the AGENT repo (.github-private)
# for its scripts, NOT the PR's repo (pr-review.yml "Checkout agent repo"). There are
# therefore no local git objects for the PR under review, so every comparison here is
# done through the `gh` API against the PR's repo. Diff-vs-merge-base is GitHub's
# three-dot compare (`compare/{base}...{sha}`), which — unlike diff-vs-base-tip
# (`base..sha`) — is invariant to base movement for a clean merge and is the only
# comparison that can match after the base advances (#1865 implementer note).
#
# All the pure decision helpers take JSON / files as input so they are unit-testable
# with no network; evaluate_carry_forward is the thin gh wrapper the cascade calls.

#   Independent conflict/content guard for a single intervening merge commit M

#   {filename, sha} where sha is the RESULTING blob at M. <base_delta_files_json> is
#   the file list from compare({first_parent}...{base_side_parent}) — the changes the
#   base side contributed since the merge-base, each {filename, sha} where sha is the
#   base's blob.
#
#   A conflict-free merge simply applies the base's blobs onto the PR branch, so every
#   file M changed must resolve to the base's blob — i.e. M's (filename, sha) set must
#   be a SUBSET of the base delta's (filename, sha) set. If M changed any file to a
#   blob the base did not produce (a resolved conflict, an "evil merge", or content
#   authored into the merge), the subset relation breaks and we FAIL toward reviewing
#   — even if the endpoint diffs coincidentally match (AC #2 is non-negotiable). This
#   is deliberately conservative: a clean merge that combines non-overlapping edits to
#   the SAME file yields a hybrid blob that is not the base's blob, so it too falls to
#   a full review — safe, never unsafe.
#   Exit 0 iff every file changed by the merge resolves to a base-produced blob.
