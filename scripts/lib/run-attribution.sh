# run-attribution.sh — pure run→role attribution for the collapsed agent-ingress
# (ADR-0007, epic #1723, story #1727).
#
# Phase 2 of the Class-1 caller collapse folds many per-role caller stubs into ONE
# agent-ingress.yml with one job per role (role-bearing job keys: dev-lead,
# pr-review-mention, …). The fleet monitor and pr-review health scans sample runs
# BY WORKFLOW NAME; once many workflow names collapse into one, every role lands in
# a single "agent-ingress" bucket — the ADR-0006-fact-3 attribution regression.
#
# These helpers retarget ingress runs to key on the role-bearing JOB name (via the
# jobs API), while legacy per-role workflows keep their workflow-name (basename)
# bucket. A role that ran both before AND after the collapse therefore lands in the
# SAME bucket (parity, AC #4). A run whose role cannot be named is bucketed under a
# loud UNATTRIBUTED sentinel rather than silently dropped (AC #5).
#
# All functions are PURE: args / stdin -> stdout, no network, no side effects.
# Network I/O lives in the wrappers that source this (scripts/fleet_monitor.sh,
# scripts/pr_review_health.sh). Unit-tested in tests/run_attribution.bats.
#
# Normalized bucket-input shape: JSON array of {role, conclusion}.
# Bucket TSV (5 fields): role <TAB> total <TAB> success <TAB> failed <TAB> cancelled
