# shadow-compare.sh — shadow-mode dual-run comparison + promotion signal (#605).
#
# Shadow-mode runs the `next`-channel agent in parallel with the `stable` agent on
# the same PR: only `stable`'s output is posted to the PR, while `next` runs as a
# silent shadow whose output is logged and compared against `stable`. The
# comparison yields a quality-regression signal that the health-gated promotion
# gate (#501) consumes as a required input before advancing a candidate ring.
# This unblocks the self-improving-skills proposer (#587), which gates on a safe
# canary; it is part of the Safe Release Strategy (#495).
#
# This library is PURE — sourced by the wrapper (scripts/shadow-run.sh) and by
# tests. No network, no agent dispatch, no side effects. The wrapper owns I/O.
#
# Classification (sc_classify), stable-vs-shadow on the same PR:
#   MATCH          both succeed, outputs equal after normalization — strongest
#                  healthy signal (candidate reproduces production exactly)
#   DIVERGED       both succeed but outputs differ — ADVISORY only. Review quality
#                  is not objectively measurable (A/B quality routing is deferred,
#                  see docs/initiatives/agentic-release-strategy.md §5/Option D),
#                  so a divergence is logged for human review but does not block.
#   REGRESSION     stable succeeds but shadow does not (failed/empty/errored) —
#                  the candidate did demonstrably worse than production on the same
#                  input. This is the one BLOCKING signal for promotion.
#   SHADOW_ONLY_OK stable did not succeed but shadow did — the candidate may be a
#                  fix; do not block promotion on an unrelated stable failure.
#   BOTH_FAILED    neither succeeded — environmental / PR-specific, not attributable
#                  to the candidate. Inconclusive, non-blocking.
#   NO_SHADOW      no shadow run was observed — inconclusive, non-blocking.
#
# Only REGRESSION blocks promotion (sc_is_blocking); every other status is
# healthy, advisory, or inconclusive. This keeps the gate conservative: it halts a
# candidate only when it is provably worse than the version it would replace.
