# sync-scope-check.sh — the sync-PR SCOPE guard (issue #1700 AC1, #1523 post-mortem).
#
# #1523 was closed as unsafe-to-merge after surviving three weeks / 255 commits:
# a generated sync PR that claimed to sync three workflow stubs had, under
# automation, also touched package.json (the deliberately-absent trunk-corruption
# signature #1485/#1519), prompts/**, evals/** and scripts/**. Nothing failed it.
#
# This library is the mechanical net: a GENERATED sync PR records the exact set
# of paths it intends to sync, and a required CI check fails the PR when its diff
# touches any path OUTSIDE that declared set. The matching is pure/deterministic
# (literal + glob, no model involvement) so a mechanical failure is caught by a
# mechanical guard.
#
# It is a set of PURE functions; the network side (fetching PR body/labels/files
# and failing the check) is the caller's job (scripts/sync-scope-guard.sh).
#
#   sync_extract_declared_paths            (reads PR body on stdin)
#     Print one declared path per line from the body's declared-paths marker
#     block; nothing when the body has no marker.
#   is_generated_sync_pr <labels> <body>
#     Exit 0 when the PR is a generated sync PR — it carries the sync label OR
#     the declared-paths marker — so the guard enforces only on generated PRs,
#     never on human PRs (AC#4). Exit 1 otherwise.
#   sync_scope_violations <declared_nl> <changed_nl>
#     Print each changed path NOT covered by the declared set (literal or glob),
#     one per line; empty output when every changed path is in scope.

# The declared set lives in the PR body between these markers (an HTML comment
# so it is invisible in the rendered PR yet machine-readable — GitHub search
# cannot index it, matching the repo's other body-marker conventions).
