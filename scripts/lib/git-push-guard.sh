# git-push-guard.sh — no-clobber push helper for dev-lead (#1311, #1607).
#
# dev-lead must never overwrite a commit it has not seen. A concurrent writer —
# a human pushing a steering commit to the same branch, or the auto-rebase bot —
# can advance the remote head after dev-lead checked the branch out. Two defects
# this guard closes:
#
#   #1311  A plain push can only be REJECTED (never overwrites); a rewritten
#          branch was force-with-leased, aborting if the remote advanced beyond
#          the remote-tracking ref captured at checkout.
#
#   #1607  A bare --force-with-lease leases against the *remote-tracking ref*.
#          If any `git fetch` earlier in the run refreshed origin/<branch> to a
#          maintainer's steering commit, the lease silently PASSES and the
#          force-push discards a commit HEAD never incorporated — exactly how a
#          maintainer steering commit was destroyed on #1604. Two hardening
#          measures fix this:
#            a. incorporate_remote_head re-fetches the true remote head before
#               pushing and either rebases HEAD onto it (incorporating a
#               concurrent commit) or, when it cannot be incorporated cleanly,
#               STOPS and escalates. A commit authored by anyone other than
#               dev-lead's own identity is treated as steering: never discarded,
#               and called out in the run summary.
#            b. every force push adds --force-if-includes, so the force ABORTS
#               unless the commits being overwritten are reachable from a ref we
#               actually fetched (i.e. we truly incorporated them) — the lease
#               alone is not enough once a fetch has refreshed it.
#
# Usage: push_no_clobber [git push args...]   e.g. push_no_clobber origin main

# (see setup_git_identity in git-identity.sh) — so match ONLY those two forms.
# A bare "*<login>@…" suffix match would also accept a spoofed local-part such as
# attacker-<login>@users.noreply.github.com and misclassify a foreign commit as
# dev-lead-owned; anchoring the local part to the exact login (optionally an
# all-digit user-id prefix) closes that. Anything else — a human maintainer's
# real email, another bot — is foreign (steering) and must never be silently

#   2  STOP/escalate — the remote has a steering commit that could not be

#
# Side effects: may rebase the current branch onto the fetched remote head;
# flags steering incorporation/escalation to the run summary.
