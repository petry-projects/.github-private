# dev-lead-retry.sh — scan open PRs + issues for failure markers and re-dispatch
#
# timer_role: safety-net (docs/agentic-interaction-model.md §6.1). This is the
# 2 h cron's *backstop* — NOT the normal-path convergence clock it used to be
# (the #860 "amplifier"). Since #1407, a blocked/rate-limited dev-lead state is
# resumed EVENT-FIRST the moment a clearing event arrives (a review submitted or
# a check_run success) via scripts/dev-lead-resume.sh; this timer only catches
# the rare, genuinely un-eventable rate-limit recovery where no such event ever
# fires. Both paths dispatch through the SAME logic here (scan_pr_for_rate_limits)
# and the SAME stop-condition (pr_resume_suppressed), so the timer can never
# re-dispatch work the event path would not.
#
# Stop-condition-before-acting (§6.2.1): every scan re-checks, BEFORE any
# dispatch, that the PR is still open, is not human-gated (needs-human-review),
# has not exhausted its per-PR automation budget, and that the rate-limit reset
# window has actually elapsed with no terminal marker already posted.
#
# Called by the dev-lead-retry.yml scheduled cron workflow.
# Scans all open PRs across TARGET_ORG (plus DELEGATION_ORGS if set) for
# status=rate-limited markers on the current HEAD SHA, then re-dispatches the
# appropriate dev-lead event so the run is retried once the rate limit clears.
#
# It ALSO scans open issues labeled `dev-lead` for failed initial implementations
# (#781): an issue whose `Run issue` engine step failed carries a
# `<!-- dev-lead-issue <N> status=<failed|rate-limited> attempt=<K> ... -->`
# marker (written by dev-lead-fix-issue.sh). Those are re-dispatched as
# dev-lead-issue-retry up to MAX_ATTEMPTS, after which fix-issue.sh escalates to
# a human (dev-lead:needs-human) and the scan skips them.
#
# Env (required):
#   GH_TOKEN            — PAT with repo + contents:write scopes
#   TARGET_ORG          — GitHub org to scan (default: petry-projects)
#
# Env (optional):
#   DELEGATION_ORGS     — space-separated additional orgs to scan
#   DISPATCH_DELAY_SEC  — seconds between repo dispatches (default: 30) to
#                         prevent cascading org-wide rate-limit hits
#   DRY_RUN             — if "true", log what would be dispatched but don't send
#   NOW_ISO             — override current time for testing (ISO-8601 UTC)
#   BOT_COMMENT_RETRY_CLAIM_SETTLE_SEC — seconds to wait after posting a
#                         bot-comment retry marker before re-listing markers
#                         to pick the earliest (default: 5), so a concurrent
#                         scan's marker is visible to the listing
#
# Retryable intents: fix-reviews, review-changes, rebase
#   These intents fetch all needed context (open threads, PR metadata) fresh
#   from the GitHub API at run time, so a re-dispatch has full fidelity.
#
# It ALSO re-dispatches fix-reviews for a bot comment EDITED after its dev-lead
# disposition (#2008). CodeRabbit edits one summary comment in place, for example
# to append a Security Architecture finding, and dev-lead only fires on CREATED
# comments. The caller stub's `on:` is standards-owned, so this sweep is the
# trigger. It is deduplicated: a successful fix-reviews run marker posted
# at/after the edit means a pass already saw the edited body, so CodeRabbit's
# frequent progress edits don't each spawn a run (stale_disposition_needs_dispatch).
#
# NOT retried automatically: on-mention
#   on-mention requires USER_INSTRUCTION from the original triggering event,
#   which cannot be reconstructed from the PR's current state. Users are asked
#   to re-trigger manually.
#
# fix-bot-comment IS retried, by a separate scan (#2017). A registered reviewer
#   bot's issue comment still exists, so its context can be rebuilt: the retry
#   dispatch carries only the comment's node id, and dev-lead-intent.sh
#   re-fetches the comment's CURRENT body, author and lastEditedAt by that id.
#   scan_pr_for_undispositioned_bot_comments finds open dev-lead PRs where such
#   a comment has no covering disposition and no info_status_pattern match, and
#   dispatches one deduplicated fix-bot-comment pass (lib/bot-comment-retry.sh).
#   This recovers the run GitHub drops when a burst of PR events supersedes the
#   pending fix-bot-comment run in the per-PR concurrency lane (#2009).
#
# Unreplied bot review threads are retried too (#2046). A trusted reviewer bot's
#   review thread is processed only by a fix-reviews pass. When that pass is lost,
#   the thread keeps blocking the merge with no reply.
#   scan_pr_for_unreplied_bot_threads finds unresolved, non-outdated, bot-opened
#   threads with no reply from our automation, and dispatches one deduplicated
#   fix-reviews pass per PR (lib/bot-thread-retry.sh). Threads that exhaust their
#   attempts get a single visible notice, so the stall is never silent.

# trusted reviewer bot opened and our automation never replied to. If any is past
# the grace period, it dispatches ONE fix-reviews retry for the PR (#2046). The

# dispatch covers them all. A second would supersede the first in the per-PR
# lane. Dedup (pending, rate limit, attempt caps) lives in the pure
# btr_retry_decisions. The claim marker is posted before the dispatch, so this
# cron and pr-review's gate hook never both dispatch. Threads that run out of
# attempts get one visible notice. Prints only the number of dispatches to
# stdout; all other output goes to stderr. Fails closed (0 dispatches) on any
# read failure. It never replies to or resolves a thread.
