# pr-approval-diagnostic.sh — "why isn't this PR approved?" (#1894)
#
# Answers from the REAL gate chain, not a model of it: runs scripts/review-one-pr.sh
# in diagnose mode (PR_REVIEW_DIAGNOSE=true — read-only, never forced, stops before
# any model runs) and reports the single verdict that run reaches — which gate holds
# the PR, and what would change the decision — together with the PR facts a reader
# needs (review decision, approvals at the head, hold labels, merge state).
#
# The previous attempt (#1902) re-implemented each gate in a separate library and
# drifted from the real ones (bot-comment handling, the unsupported-file regex,
# check-run participation, the thread-gate fail-closed path). Running the gate chain
# itself makes that drift impossible: a gate change is a diagnostic change.
#
# Usage: pr-approval-diagnostic.sh <pr-url> [--json]
#   Needs the same environment a pr-review run needs to READ the PR (GH_TOKEN with
#   repo read; BOT_USER defaults to donpetry-bot). Writes nothing to GitHub.
# Exit: 0 diagnosed · 2 no diagnosis: the gate chain produced no verdict (its log
#       tail is printed), the PR facts could not be read, or the head moved while
#       diagnosing (re-run)
