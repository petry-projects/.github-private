# extract-fewshot.sh — build de-identified few-shot examples from this repo's
# merged-PR review->merge histories and store them in a proposer-visible dev
# split (issue #1093, epic #1088, Phase 2, Task 1).
#
# The deep-review tier reads these examples (via the $FEWSHOT_FILE optional-file
# contract assembled by scripts/lib/fewshot.sh) to calibrate to what this repo's
# maintainers actually accept and flag. Each example captures ONE past outcome:
# the PR's title/summary plus the review decision (approve|escalate) and risk.
#
# Held-out discipline (AC #2). The output MUST land under a proposer-visible dev
# split, NEVER under evals/**/holdout — the set the held-out gate later scores
# against. fewshot_source_is_holdout (the same guard the assembler enforces)
# hard-refuses a holdout output path here too, so a mis-pointed --out can never
# write into the held-out set.
#
# De-identification (evals/README.md decision A3). Every text field is scrubbed
# of secrets, tokens, internal hostnames, and PII via fewshot_scrub BEFORE it is
# committed — cases are redacted reconstructions, never raw captured content.
#
# Usage:
#   extract-fewshot.sh [--repo <owner/repo>] [--limit N] [--out <path>]
#
# Defaults: --repo $GITHUB_REPOSITORY, --limit 30,
#           --out evals/deep-review/dev/fewshot.jsonl
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated), jq. Exits non-zero on a holdout --out, missing
# tooling, or a failed fetch.

# Second pass: de-identify every string field (A3) AND neutralise prompt-injection
# vectors in the attacker-controllable merged-PR text (title/summary/body). This
# runs as a single O(1)-process pipeline instead of spawning jq+sed per example:
#   1. @tsv flattens each example to one row and escapes any embedded newline/tab/
#      CR in the merged text to a literal \n/\t/\r — so a crafted PR title or body
#      cannot forge new lines or headers when the example is later rendered into
#      the deep-review prompt (structural hardening on top of credential scrubbing;
#      the deep prompt also treats FEWSHOT as informational context, never an
#      instruction).
#   2. fewshot_scrub redacts secrets/tokens/hostnames/PII across the whole stream.
#   3. the row is reconstructed into a compact JSONL object.
