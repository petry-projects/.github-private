# discover-parity-skills.sh — list the skills scored at PARITY tier (#1702).
#
# The weekly persona-parity cadence in skill-eval-report.yml scores a skill at
# the tier its evals/<skill>/scorer.json declares. A skill is at parity when it
# declares `"engine": "persona"`; a skill without that field defaults to the
# Haiku-tier triage scorer and is NOT part of this cadence. This script derives
# that set from the scorer configs themselves — never a hardcoded skill list —
# so adding a persona to the parity cadence requires no edit to the workflow
# (AC #3, the same derive-don't-enumerate rule as the `<id>:hands-off` family,
# #756). It is the single source of truth run-eval.sh already reads for the tier.
#
# Emits a single-line JSON array of skill names (sorted, unique) to stdout, ready
# to feed a GitHub Actions `strategy.matrix`. An evals tree with no parity skill
# emits `[]` — never a crash — so the matrix simply has no jobs.
#
# Env overrides:
#   EVALS_DIR   held-out eval root (default: <repo>/evals); read-only. Mirrors
#               run-eval.sh so offline tests point it at a fixture tree.
