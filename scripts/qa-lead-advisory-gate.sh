# qa-lead-advisory-gate.sh — the pure fire/skip decision for the qa-lead PR
# advisory (issue #1646 — [qa-lead S3]).
#
# The workflow (.github/workflows/qa-lead-pr-advisory.yml) gathers a PR's signals
# — changed files, labels, whether a qa-lead advisory already exists, whether the
# automation budget is exhausted — and calls qa_lead_gate_decision, which is pure
# and unit-tested (tests/test_qa_lead_advisory_gate.bats) so every suppressor has
# a regression test. Keeping the policy here (not inline in yaml) is what lets us
# pin it.
#
# It composes:
#   AC #3  the test-surface heuristic          (qa_lead_test_surface)
#   AC #4  the qa-lead:hands-off opt-out label
#   AC #5  one advisory per PR (idempotency)
#   AC #6  budget / human gates — reusing pr_has_escalation_label as the CANONICAL
#          needs-human-review check (do NOT re-derive it here)
#
# Sourcing this file pulls in the heuristic + budget libs and defines the pure
# decision functions WITHOUT running main (guarded by BASH_SOURCE == $0).
