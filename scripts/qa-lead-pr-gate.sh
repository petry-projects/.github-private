# qa-lead-pr-gate.sh — signal gathering + fire/skip decision for the qa-lead
# pull_request advisory (issue #1905).
#
# This is the ONE implementation of the gathering the qa-lead PR advisory needs,
# shared by BOTH callers so the suppressors are identical, not copied:
#   * .github/workflows/qa-lead-pr-advisory.yml — the local, event-driven surface
#     (its gate job sources this and calls qa_lead_pr_gather_and_decide), and
#   * .github/workflows/persona-runner-reusable.yml — the router-served surface
#     (its event pre-gate calls it via scripts/persona-pr-pregate.sh).
# Before #1905 the gathering lived inline in the local workflow's YAML, so the
# router-served pull_request path had NONE of it and posted on every trusted PR.
#
# It gathers the PR's signals via `gh` and hands them to the pure, unit-tested
# decision qa_lead_gate_decision (scripts/qa-lead-advisory-gate.sh). Sourcing this
# file pulls in that decision + the heuristic/budget libs WITHOUT running main
# (guarded by BASH_SOURCE == $0 there).

# _qa_lead_pr_gate_fail_closed <repo> <pr> <what>

#   (AGENTS.md: "when an input can't be resolved, fail loudly and name the
#   derivation that failed") and print the skip decision. Silence is the safe
#   default — a signal we cannot read must never degrade to an empty value that

#   Gather the PR's signals and return the fire/skip decision. Prints exactly one

#   skip. Any unreadable signal fails closed (skip) via the helper above.

#   Signals gathered (identical to the local workflow's former gate job):

#       guards, so a truncated or LF-forged list never mislabels the PR;
#     * label names — never degraded to [] on an API error (that would bypass the
#       opt-out / human gates);
#     * existing qa-lead advisory marker (idempotency);
#     * per-PR automation budget events (#860/#926 breaker).
