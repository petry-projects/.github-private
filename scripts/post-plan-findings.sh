# post-plan-findings.sh — structured-findings output channel for the plan_json
# artifact type (issue #614, epic #610 Phase 2).
#
# This is the plan_json half of the review artifact contract's output_channel:
# the rubric registry (scripts/lib/review-registry.tsv) maps artifact_type
# plan_json -> {rubric: prompts/plan-review.md, output_channel: THIS script}.
#
# Unlike the pr_diff channel (scripts/post-pr-review.sh, which posts a GitHub PR
# review), a plan is consumed by the *planner*, not a human on a PR. So this
# channel delivers the critic's verdict as MACHINE-READABLE findings JSON the
# planner can read before apply-plan.sh materializes the epic/DAG. It NEVER
# posts a GitHub review and NEVER calls post-pr-review.sh.
#
# Inputs:
#   $1 — content_ref: the plan.json path that was reviewed (for the log line).
#   $2 — findings JSON path: the rubric's output (see prompts/plan-review.md).
#   $3 — DRY_RUN (true/false). Findings are local artifacts, so delivery is the
#        same either way; the flag is accepted for output-channel contract
#        symmetry with post-pr-review.sh and surfaced in the log.
#
# Env:
#   PLAN_FINDINGS_OUTPUT — optional destination path. When set, the validated
#        findings JSON is written there for the planner to consume. When unset,
#        the findings are summarized to stdout only.
#
# Findings JSON shape (emitted by prompts/plan-review.md):
#   {
#     "artifact_type": "plan_json",
#     "verdict": "pass|revise",
#     "summary": "...",
#     "findings": [ { "severity","category","message","story_id","location" } ]
#   }
#
# Exit codes: 0 on a well-formed verdict (pass or revise); non-zero when the
# findings file is missing, unparseable, or carries an unknown verdict.
