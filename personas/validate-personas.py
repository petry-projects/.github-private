"""Validate agentic persona manifests.

Every `personas/<id>/persona.yml` is validated against the canonical persona
schema (owned by petry-projects/.github) PLUS the cross-invariants the JSON
schema cannot express on its own:

  * `id` == the persona directory name == `canary.agent`
  * `address.handle`'s team slug == `id` (so a mention routes by prefix-strip).
    This makes handle uniqueness a THEOREM rather than a check: the schema pins
    the org (^petry-projects/...), slug == id, id == the persona directory name,
    and directory names are unique — so two personas cannot claim the same
    handle. There is deliberately no cross-file uniqueness check.

    Scope of that claim: it covers `address.handle`, which is the only thing the
    mention router resolves. `address.aliases` shared the handle namespace and
    was NOT covered by it — which is why a uniqueness check existed while
    aliases did. Aliases are being removed from the addressing contract
    (petry-projects/.github#755 finding 1); this repo has already dropped every
    use, and the companion PR drops the field from the schema. Until that lands
    the schema still PERMITS an alias, so re-adding one here would reopen the
    namespace this theorem does not cover. Do not.
  * every `definition.layers[].path` exists on disk
  * every `skills[].path` exists on disk, and when it points at a `<name>/SKILL.md`
    the directory name equals the entry `name` (name<->path agreement)
  * a `framework-agent` layer's `framework.vendor_pin` actually appears in the
    referenced `frameworks/<name>/VENDOR.md` (pin ↔ vendored version agree)
  * each eval set (`evals.path`, or every entry of `evals.paths`) carries both
    `dev/cases.jsonl` and `holdout/cases.jsonl`; and once the persona has reached
    its `evals.required_before` ring, each held-out set has >= `min_cases`
    (the enforceable half of principle 5 — a draft is exempt)
  * registration matches the manifest's own declaration (ADR-0006): a persona
    WITH a `canary` block ships its own reusable, so past `draft` it must have a
    matching `agents.<id>` entry in `canary-rings.json` (status never outruns
    registration); a persona WITHOUT one rides the shared persona runtime, is
    never ring-registered, and must NOT appear in the registry at all

Schema resolution order (#1707):
  1. --schema PATH                     (explicit local file; used by tests)
  2. $PERSONA_SCHEMA_FILE              (local file)
  3. $PERSONA_SCHEMA_REF               (explicit ref; exactly this, no widening)
  4. the standards channel             (STANDARDS_CHANNEL, default standards/v1-stable)
     PLUS its N-1 immutable release    (a manifest valid under EITHER passes)

The schema lives in the org standards repo, not here — this validator reads it
the same way any consumer repo reads a published standard. When run against the
canary registry check, the registry is read the same way.

Why the channel, not `main`: the standard is versioned but the fetch used to be
pinned to the org repo's DEFAULT BRANCH, so a merge there changed the pass/fail
verdict of every open PR here with no coordinating change on this side (the
2026-09-07 outage: an org-repo schema tightening red-lined the whole fleet 21
seconds after it merged). Pinning to a moving channel tag — the same model
scripts/seed-repo-template.sh already uses (STANDARDS_CHANNEL, #1448) — decouples
this repo's verdict from unpublished org-repo commits. Accepting N-1 for the
schema means promoting a standards version does not fail every consumer at once
mid-propagation. A pinned-channel MISS is a LOUD, named fallback (a ::warning::
naming the ref wanted and the ref used) — never a silent widening back to `main`,
which is exactly the coupling this removes.

Usage:
  validate-personas.py [personas_root] [--schema PATH] [--registry PATH]

Exit 0 on success; non-zero with a diagnostic on the first failure class found.
