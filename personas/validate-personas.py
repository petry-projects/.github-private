"""Validate agentic persona manifests.

Every `personas/<id>/persona.yml` is validated against the canonical persona
schema (owned by petry-projects/.github) PLUS the cross-invariants the JSON
schema cannot express on its own:

  * `id` == the persona directory name == `canary.agent`
  * `address.handle`'s team slug == `id` (so a mention routes by prefix-strip).
    This makes handle uniqueness a THEOREM rather than a check: the schema pins
    the org (^petry-projects/...), slug == id, id == the persona directory name,
    and directory names are unique — so two personas cannot claim the same
    handle. There is deliberately no cross-file uniqueness check.

    Scope of that claim: it covers `address.handle`, which is the only thing the
    mention router resolves. `address.aliases` shared the handle namespace and
    was NOT covered by it — which is why a uniqueness check existed while
    aliases did. Aliases are being removed from the addressing contract
    (petry-projects/.github#755 finding 1); this repo has already dropped every
    use, and the companion PR drops the field from the schema. Until that lands
    the schema still PERMITS an alias, so re-adding one here would reopen the
    namespace this theorem does not cover. Do not.
  * every `definition.layers[].path` exists on disk
  * a `framework-agent` layer's `framework.vendor_pin` actually appears in the
    referenced `frameworks/<name>/VENDOR.md` (pin ↔ vendored version agree)
  * each eval set (`evals.path`, or every entry of `evals.paths`) carries both
    `dev/cases.jsonl` and `holdout/cases.jsonl`; and once the persona has reached
    its `evals.required_before` ring, each held-out set has >= `min_cases`
    (the enforceable half of principle 5 — a draft is exempt)
  * a non-`draft` persona has a matching `agents.<id>` entry in the canary ring
    registry (`canary-rings.json`), so status never outruns registration

Schema resolution order:
  1. --schema PATH                     (explicit local file; used by tests)
  2. $PERSONA_SCHEMA_FILE              (local file)
  3. fetch from petry-projects/.github at $PERSONA_SCHEMA_REF (default: main)

The schema lives in the org standards repo, not here — this validator reads it
the same way any consumer repo reads a published standard. When run against the
canary registry check, the registry is read the same way.

Usage:
  validate-personas.py [personas_root] [--schema PATH] [--registry PATH]

Exit 0 on success; non-zero with a diagnostic on the first failure class found.
